<p>Brownian motion is a fundamental tool for modeling uncertainty that resolves over time. Consider predicting a future stock price. We donâ€™t know today what the price will be tomorrow, nor what it will be the following day, nor what it will be the day after that. We can regard the price three days from now as todayâ€™s price plus the change from today to tomorrow plus the change from tomorrow to the following day plus the change from that day to the next. Thus, there are three random changes in this small example. A simple way to model this situation is to assume each change is a normally distributed random variable with some mean and variance. Thus, the price in three days is viewed as todayâ€™s price plus the sum of three normal increments.</p>
<p>Rather than predicting daily changes as in the previous paragraph, we might be interested in predicting hourly changes or even minute-to-minute changes. This will lead to more, but smaller, increments. A Brownian motion models changes at all frequencies simultaneously, with all changes being normally distributed.</p>
<p>We will ultimately deal with different means and different variances, but we start with what is called a standard Brownian motion, which is similar to beginning the study of normal random variables by studying a standard normal variable, that is, a normal random variable with a zero mean and a unit variance. The definition of a standard Brownian motion is that its change over any time interval</p>
<ul>
<li>is normally distributed</li>
<li>is independent of prior changes</li>
<li>has a zero mean</li>
<li>has a variance equal to the length of the time interval.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can plot an approximate path of a Brownian motion by summing up normally distributed changes. We take an interval of time <span class="math inline">\([0, t]\)</span> and split it up as <span class="math display">\[0=t_0 &lt; t_1&lt; \cdots &lt; t_{N-1} &lt; t_N=t\]</span> where the times <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> are equally spaced, meaning that <span class="math inline">\(t_i-t_{i-1} = t/N\)</span>, which we will call <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>. We generate <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> normally distributed random variables with zero means and variance equal to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> and define the Brownian motion, which we call <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, as the cumulative sum of the normal variables. By convention, we will start the Brownian motion at <span class="math inline">\(B_0=0\)</span>. This fits the definition of a standard Brownian motion, except that we have limited the frequency of the changes to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> changes within the interval. By taking <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> larger, we can always get a better approximation.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-brownian-path" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.1</span></a> illustrates a distinctive characteristic of a Brownian motion: it jiggles rapidly, moving up and down in a very erratic way. The name Brownian motion derives from the botanist Robert Brownâ€™s observations of the erratic behavior of particles suspended in a fluid. This has long been thought to be a reasonable model for the behavior of a stock price. The plot of other functions with which we may be familiar will be much smoother. This is captured in the concept of quadratic variation.</p>
<p>Consider a discrete partition <span class="math display">\[0=t_0 &lt; t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_N=t\]</span> of the time interval <span class="math inline">\([0,t]\)</span> as before. Let <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be a Brownian motion and calculate the sum of squared changes <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^N [\Delta B_{t_i}]^2\; ,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B_{t_i}\)</span> denotes the change <span class="math inline">\(B_{t_i}-B_{t_{i-1}}.\)</span> If we consider finer partitions with the length of each time interval <span class="math inline">\(t_i-t_{i-1}\)</span> going to zero, the limit of the sum is called the quadratic variation of the process. For a Brownian motion, the quadratic variation over an interval <span class="math inline">\([0,t]\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> with probability one. Here is a plot of the quadratic variation (that is, the cumulative sum of squared changes) of the previous approximation of a Brownian motion. The plot shows that the approximation has quadratic variation through each date <span class="math inline">\(s \le t\)</span> that is approximately equal to <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>

<p>To better visualize the convergence of the quadratic variation of a Brownian motion as the number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of subdivisions of the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, t]\)</span> grows, we encourage readers to interact with the plot below, which simulates a handful of approximate Brownian paths and their quadratic variation.</p>

<p>The typical functions with which we are familiar are continuously differentiable. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a continuously differentiable function of time, then the quadratic variation of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is zero. A simple example is a linear function: <span class="math inline">\(X_t = at\)</span> for some constant <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Then, taking <span class="math inline">\(t_i-t_{i-1} = \Delta t = T/N\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, the sum of squared changes is <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^N [\Delta X_{t_i}]^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N  [a\,\Delta t]^2 = Na^2 (\Delta t)^2 = Na^2 \left(\frac{T}{N}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2T^2}{N} \rightarrow 0\]</span> as <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. Essentially the same argument shows that the quadratic variation of any continuously differentiable function is zero, because such a function is approximately linear at each point. Thus, the jiggling of a Brownian motion, which leads to the nonzero quadratic variation, is quite unusual.</p>

<p>To explain exactly how unusual the nonzero quadratic variation is, it is helpful to consider total variation, which is defined in the same way as quadratic variation but with the squared changes <span class="math inline">\([\Delta B_{t_i}]^2\)</span> replaced by the absolute value of the changes <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta B_{t_i}|.\)</span> A general mathematical theorem states that, iff the quadratic variation of a continuous function is nonzero, then its total variation is necessarily infinite, so each path of a Brownian motion has infinite total variation (with probability one).</p>
<p>It was mentioned above that, with a large number of time steps in the simulation of the preceding section, one could see the distinctive jiggling property of a Brownian motion. This is not quite right. We can never draw a plot of a function that has infinite total variation, so we can never draw a plot of a continuous function that has nonzero quadratic variation. Another way to understand this is to zoom in on <a href="#fig-brownian-path" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.1</span></a>. If we zoom in close enough, we can see the linear steps <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B\)</span>. However, if we could zoom in on a segment of a path of a true Brownian motion, it would look much the same as the entire picture does to the naked eyeâ€”no matter how small the segment, we would still see the characteristic jiggling.</p>
<p>One may well question why we should be interested in this curious mathematical object. The reason is that asset pricing inherently involves martingales (variables that evolve randomly over time in such a way that their expected changes are always zero), as our fundamental pricing formula (<a href="Chapter_Arbitrage.html#eq-formula" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;<span>3.28</span></a>) establishes. Furthermore, continuous processes (variables whose paths are continuous functions of time) are much more tractable mathematically than are processes that can jump at some instants. More importantly, it is possible in a mathematical model with continuous processes to define perfect hedges much more readily than it is in a model involving jump processes. So, we are led to a study of continuous martingales. An important fact is that any non-constant continuous martingale must have infinite total variation! So, the normal functions with which we are familiar are left behind once we enter the study of continuous martingales.</p>
<p>There remains perhaps the question of why we focus on Brownian motion within the world of continuous martingales. The answer here is that any continuous martingale is really just a transformation of a Brownian motion. This is a consequence of the following important fact, which is known as Levyâ€™s theorem: </p>
<div id="section" class="Rule" title="">
<p></p><details class="Rule fbx-simplebox fbx-default" open=""><summary><strong>Calculation Rule 5.1</strong></summary><div>A continuous martingale is a Brownian motion if and only if its quadratic variation over each interval <span class="math inline">\([0,T]\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.<p></p>
</div></details>
</div>
<p>Thus, among continuous martingales, a Brownian motion is defined by the condition that the quadratic variation over each interval <span class="math inline">\([0,T]\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. This is really just a normalization. A different continuous martingale may have a different quadratic variation, but it can be converted to a Brownian motion just by deforming the time scale. Furthermore, many continuous martingales can be constructed as stochastic integrals with respect to a Brownian motion. We take up this topic in the next section.</p>
