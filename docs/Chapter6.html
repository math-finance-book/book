<p>We will see in this chapter how to apply the Black-Scholes formulas to value currency options and options on foreign assets. We will also discuss currency forwards and futures, quanto forwards, and return swaps.</p>
<p>For concreteness, we will call one currency the domestic currency and the other the foreign currency. Let <span class="math inline">\(X(t)\)</span> denote the exchange rate at time~<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> measured in units of the domestic currency per unit of the foreign currency. Exchange rates can be confusing, because we can look at them from the perspective of either currency, so it may help to keep in mind that <span class="math inline">\(X(t)\)</span> here means the price of a unit of the foreign currency, just as we might consider the price of a stock. When we speak of the cost or value of something without specifying the currency, it should be understood to be the domestic currency that we mean. If <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the price of a foreign asset, denominated in units of the foreign currency, we can convert it into a domestic asset price simply by multiplying by the exchange rate: <span class="math inline">\(X(t)S(t)\)</span> is the price of the asset, denominated in the domestic currency. For example, if the domestic currency is dollars and the foreign currency is yen, then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is in units of yen and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is units of dollars per unit of yen, so <span class="math inline">\(XS\)</span> is in units of dollars.</p>
<p>Throughout the chapter, we will maintain assumptions similar to the Black-Scholes assumptions. There is a foreign asset with price <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> in the foreign currency. It has a constant dividend yield <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and a constant volatility <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_s\)</span>. The exchange rate has a constant volatility <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x\)</span> and a constant correlation <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> with the foreign asset. There is a domestic risk-free asset with constant interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and a foreign risk-free asset with constant interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span>. The term risk free means of course that they are risk-free in their respective currencies. For example, an investment in the foreign risk-free asset is not risk free to a domestic investor, because of exchange rate risk.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="currency-options"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Currency Options</h2>
<p>A European call option on the exchange rate <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> pays <span class="math inline">\(\max(0,X(T)-K)\)</span> at its maturity <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the strike price (in domestic currency). The underlying asset should be regarded as the foreign risk-free asset, the domestic price of which fluctuates with the exchange rate. An investment in the foreign risk-free asset grows via reinvestment of interest at rate <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span>, just as the number of shares held of a stock grows via reinvestment of dividends at rate <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is its constant dividend yield. In particular, the cost at date~0 of obtaining one unit of foreign currency at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the cost at date 0 of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-r_fT}\)</span> units of foreign currency, which is <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-r_fT}X(0)\)</span>. Thus, the exchange rate is analogous to a stock price, with the foreign risk-free rate being its dividend yield. This means we can apply the Black-Scholes formulas to value currency calls and puts:</p>

<p>An option on a foreign asset, with the strike price defined in the foreign currency, can be priced with the Black-Scholes formula, assuming the volatility and dividend yields of the asset are constant and that the (foreign) interest rate is constant. This must be true, because we did not need to specify the currency (dollars, yen, etc.) when deriving the Black-Scholes formula. The value given by the Black-Scholes formula is in the same currency as the asset. To obtain a value in domestic currency for an option on a foreign asset, we simply multiply the Black-Scholes formula by the current exchange rate.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-s_domesticstrike"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Options on Foreign Assets Struck in Domestic Currency</h2>
<p>A call option on a foreign asset with domestic strike price <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> on the foreign asset with price <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> pays <span class="math display">\[\max(X(T)S(T)-K,0)\]</span> at its maturity <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The underlying price <span class="math inline">\(X(T)S(T)\)</span> is the value in domestic currency of the portfolio that with starts with <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-qT}\)</span> units of the asset and reinvests dividends until date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Thus, we can use the Black-Scholes formula to value it, taking the initial asset price to be <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-qT}X(0)S(0)\)</span> and the dividend rate to be zero (or taking the initial asset price to be <span class="math inline">\(X(0)S(0)\)</span> and the dividend rate to be <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>). The volatility that should be input into the Black-Scholes formula is the volatility of the domestic currency price <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-q(T-t)}X(t)S(t)\)</span>, which is the same as the volatility of <span class="math inline">\(X(t)S(t)\)</span>.<br>
According to the formula <a href="Chapter2.html#eq-volatilityproduct">Equation&nbsp;<span>2.42</span></a>, the volatility of the domestic currency price <span class="math inline">\(XS\)</span> is <span id="eq-foreignoptiondomcurrencyvol"><span class="math display">\[

<p>Consider a forward contract maturing at some date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> on one unit of foreign currency. In keeping with our convention for options, we will always assume (without loss of generality) that a forward contract is written on a single unit of currency. Let <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> denote the forward price (in domestic currency) at date <span class="math inline">\(t\leq T\)</span>. This means that someone who purchases (goes long) the contract at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> will receive a unit of foreign currency, worth <span class="math inline">\(X(T)\)</span>, at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and must pay <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The value of the long contract at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is therefore <span class="math inline">\(X(T) - F(t)\)</span>. The value at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of a short contract initiated at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the opposite: <span class="math inline">\(F(t)-X(T)\)</span>. Naturally, the forward price <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> is called the forward exchange rate. </p>
<p>The deepest market for currency is the inter-bank forward market, but futures contracts are also traded on exchanges. The difference between forwards and futures is that futures are marked to market daily. Thus, there are daily cash flows with a futures contract, whereas the only cash flows on a forward contract occur at the maturity of the forward. In both cases, there is no cash flow at the time the contract is bought/sold, so its market value is zero. In <a href="Chapter7.html#sec-s_futuresforwards"><span>Section&nbsp;7.7</span></a> we will discuss futures contracts further. In particular, we will show, assuming continuous marking to market, that if there is a constant (domestic) risk-free rate—or, more generally, if there is an instantaneous risk-free rate that changes over time in a non-random way—then futures prices must equal forward prices in the absence of arbitrage opportunities. Thus, our assumptions in this chapter imply that currency futures prices should equal currency forward prices. We will consider currency forwards in the remainder of this section.</p>
<p>A forward contract on a traded asset can always be created synthetically simply by buying the asset and holding it, using borrowed money to finance the purchase and to finance any storage costs, assuming the storage costs can be estimated in advance. If the asset pays dividends or generates other positive cash flows, then we do not need to purchase the entire amount covered by the forward contract, because we can accumulate additional amounts of the asset by reinvesting the dividends. There are no storage costs on currency and its dividend yield is equal to the foreign risk-free rate. A forward contract on one unit of foreign currency maturing at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> can be created synthetically at date 0 by buying <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-r_fT}\)</span> units of foreign currency and borrowing the cost <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-r_fT}X(0)\)</span> at the domestic risk-free rate. This will lead to ownership of one unit of foreign currency at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and a liability, including interest, of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{(r-r_f)T}X(0)\)</span> at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Thus, the forward price at date 0 must be <span class="math inline">\(F(0) = \mathrm{e}^{(r-r_f)T}X(0)\)</span>; otherwise, one could arbitrage by buying the forward and selling the synthetic forward, or vice versa. More generally,</p>

<p>The forward exchange rate at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, for a contract maturing at <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, must be <span id="eq-forwardexchangerate"><span class="math display">\[
F(t) = \mathrm{e}^{(r-r_f)(T-t)}X(t)\;.
\tag{6.2}\]</span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The relation <a href="#eq-forwardexchangerate">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.2</span></a> is called covered interest parity. The name stems from the fact that an investment in one of the risk-free assets (foreign or domestic) financed by borrowing in the other, with the currency risk hedged (covered) by a forward contract, is certain to generate zero value (otherwise, it would be an arbitrage opportunity).^[ A relation analogous to covered interest parity holds for any forward contract if the underlying asset has a constant dividend yield and storage costs that are a constant proportion of the value of the units stored. For commodities, the term dividend yield must be interpreted in a broad sense, and is usually called convenience yield, </p>
<p>Suppose that one has made a commitment to pay a certain amount of foreign currency (perhaps to a foreign manufacturer) at some date in the future. The exchange rate risk that this commitment entails can obviously be hedged by buying the currency forward. However, one can also create a synthetic forward, by buying currency today and investing it in the foreign risk-free asset. The cash outflow can be incurred today, or it can be deferred by borrowing the cost of the currency at the domestic risk-free rate. In the latter case, we have created a true synthetic forward. In either case, we would call this a money market hedge because we have utilized the foreign money market (risk-free asset) to create the hedge.</p>
<p>Later in this chapter we will construct replicating strategies for various contracts using the foreign risk-free asset and the domestic risk-free asset. One can interpret these replicating strategies as money market hedges or synthetic currency forwards. In practice, it will often be more convenient to use actual forwards rather than using the foreign risk-free asset. Using actual currency forwards produces an equivalent (given that we are not considering transaction costs) replicating strategy. Here is, in abstract, the way we convert from money market hedges to hedges using forwards. As we have discussed, <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}

\text{Long Currency Forward} + \text{Long Domestic Risk-Free Asset}\\=  \text{Long Foreign Risk-Free Asset} \; .
\end{multline*}\]</span> Thus, an investment in the foreign risk-free asset can be replaced in any replicating strategy by long currency forwards and an investment in the domestic risk-free asset.</p>
<p>To be more precise about the sizes of the investments, consider replacing a money market hedge with a forward hedge at some date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> prior to the maturity of the forward and analyze the replacement per unit of the money market hedge (per unit of foreign currency invested in the foreign risk-free asset). One unit of foreign currency invested in the foreign risk-free asset at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> will grow to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{r_f(T-t)}\)</span> units by date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Thus, the corresponding forward contract should be on <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{r_f(T-t)}\)</span> units of currency. The value at date~<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of both sides of the above equation should be the same, and the value of a forward contract at the date of initiation is zero, so the investment in the domestic risk-free asset should be the domestic currency equivalent of one unit of foreign currency, which is the exchange rate <span class="math inline">\(X(t)\)</span>. Thus, we have</p>

<p>A quanto is a derivative written on a foreign asset the value of which is converted to domestic currency at a fixed exchange rate. In other words, the contract pays in the domestic currency and the exchange rate is part of the contract. Such contracts are very useful for investors who want to bet on foreign assets but do not want exposure to exchange rate risk. Such an investor could simply buy the foreign asset and hedge the currency risk by selling currency futures or forwards, but doing so is a bit tricky because the amount of currency that needs to be hedged depends on how well the foreign asset does. Thus, quantos can be desirable contracts. Of course, when an investor purchases a quanto, the problem of hedging the exchange rate risk has simply been transferred to the seller. In this and the following section, we will see how to value and how to replicate a contract that pays the price of a foreign asset at some future date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> with the price translated into the domestic currency at a fixed exchange rate. The replicating strategy is the strategy that would be followed by the seller (or by an investor who wants to create a synthetic on his own). Specifically, in this section we will determine the value at date 0 (in domestic currency) of a contract that pays <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S(T)\)</span> at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> is a fixed exchange rate. Later in the chapter, we will consider quanto forwards and quanto options.</p>
<p>In addition to being practically useful, this contract is an excellent example for demonstrating the methodology of pricing and hedging. The best way to proceed in problems of this general type is to first value the contract and then calculate the replicating strategy.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>: we first derived the Black-Scholes formula and then found the replicating strategy (delta hedge) by differentiating the formula. As discussed in <a href="Chapter1.html#sec-s_introoptions"><span>Section&nbsp;1.5</span></a>, valuation is simplified by choosing a numeraire that will cancel the randomness in the contract payoff. Our numeraire must be a non-dividend-paying (domestic) asset price, so we can choose <span class="math inline">\(Z(t)=X(t)\mathrm{e}^{qt}S(t)\)</span> to be the numeraire asset price. This is the value in the domestic currency of a strategy that is long one unit of the foreign asset at date 0 and which reinvests the dividends of the asset into new shares. As we will see immediately, using it as numeraire introduces randomness into the payoff through the exchange rate, and that poses some complications. Applying our fundamental pricing formula <a href="Chapter1.html#eq-formula">Equation&nbsp;<span>1.28</span></a>, the value of the contract is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Z(0) E^Z \left[\frac{\bar{X}S(T)}{Z(T)}\right] = \mathrm{e}^{-qT}X(0)S(0)E^Z \left[\frac{\bar{X}S(T)}{X(T)S(T)}\right]
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
= \mathrm{e}^{-qT}\bar{X}S(0)E^Z \left[\frac{X(0)}{X(T)}\right]\;.

<p>Now we need to evaluate <span class="math inline">\(E^Z[X(0)/X(T)]\)</span>, which is the expected growth of <span class="math inline">\(1/X\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is used as the numeraire. We will show that <span class="math display">\[

\end{align*}\]</span> Now we use <a href="Chapter2.html#eq-other11">Equation&nbsp;<span>2.33</span></a> in <a href="Chapter2.html#sec-s_girsanov"><span>Section&nbsp;2.9</span></a> which gives the drift of an asset when another risky asset is used as the numeraire. We use <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> as the numeraire and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as the other asset, regarding <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as the domestic price of an asset with dividend yield <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span> as before. Therefore, we substitute <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in <a href="Chapter2.html#eq-other11">Equation&nbsp;<span>2.33</span></a>, substitute <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> for the volatility of the numeraire asset price, substitute <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x\)</span> for the volatility of the other asset, and substitute <span class="math inline">\((\sigma_x+\rho\sigma_s)/\sigma\)</span> for their correlation.

Now we apply Ito’s formula for ratios to obtain <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} (1/X)}{1/X} &amp;= -\frac{\mathrm{d} X}{X} + \left(\frac{\mathrm{d} X}{X}\right)^2\\

</div>
</div>
<p>The assets we will use to replicate the payoff <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S(T)\)</span> are the foreign asset with price <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, the foreign risk-free asset, and the domestic risk-free asset. At the end of this section, we will explain how to replace the foreign risk-free asset with currency forwards, as discussed in <a href="#sec-s_currencyforwards"><span>Section&nbsp;6.4</span></a>. Before beginning the calculations, we can make the following intuitive observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The payoff <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S(T)\)</span> has exposure to the foreign asset price <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, so the replicating portfolio must be long the foreign asset.<br>
</li>
<li>The payoff <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S(T)\)</span> has no exposure to the exchange rate, so the replicating portfolio cannot have any exposure to the exchange rate either. Thus, the long position in the foreign risky asset must be offset by an equal short position in the foreign risk-free asset.<br>
</li>
<li>As a result of the previous observation, the value of the replicating portfolio, displayed in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto1</span>, will equal the investment in the domestic risk-free asset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, our real task is to compute the number of shares of the foreign asset that should be held, the remainder of the replicating portfolio being thereby determined.</p>
<p>The value of the replicating portfolio at any date <span class="math inline">\(t\leq T\)</span> must be the value at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of receiving the payoff <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S(T)\)</span> at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We have calculated this value at date 0, and, clearly, the formula <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto1</span> applies to general dates <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, when we replace the time <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to maturity by <span class="math inline">\(T-t\)</span> and the asset price <span class="math inline">\(S(0)\)</span> at the date of valuation by <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span>. That is, the value of the portfolio at any date <span class="math inline">\(t\leq T\)</span> must be <span class="math inline">\(V(t)\)</span> defined as <span class="math display">\[
V(t) = \exp\left\{(r_f - r-q-\rho\sigma_x\sigma_s)(T-t)\right\}\bar{X}S(t)\;.
\]</span> As just noted, we will need to invest this amount in the domestic risk-free asset at date~<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. What remains to be done is to calculate the size of the long position in the foreign risky asset and the offsetting short position in the foreign risk-free asset.</p>
<p>From Ito’s formula, we have <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d} V}{V} = -(r_f - r-q-\rho\sigma_x\sigma_s)\,\mathrm{d} t + \frac{\mathrm{d} S}{S}\;.
\]</span> Equivalently, <span class="math display">\[
\mathrm{d} V =(r+q-r_f+\rho\sigma_x\sigma_s)V\,\mathrm{d} t + V\frac{\mathrm{d} S}{S}\;.
\]</span> On the other hand, consider a strategy that invests <span class="math inline">\(a(t)\)</span> units of the domestic currency in the foreign asset, <span class="math inline">\(b(t)\)</span> units of the domestic currency in the foreign risk-free asset, and <span class="math inline">\(c(t)\)</span> units of the domestic currency in the domestic risk-free asset. Let <span class="math inline">\(W=a+b+c\)</span> denote the value of this portfolio. The return on the foreign asset, per unit of domestic currency invested, is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d} (X\mathrm{e}^{qt}S)}{X\mathrm{e}^{qt}S} = q\,\mathrm{d} t+\frac{\mathrm{d} X}{X} + \frac{\mathrm{d} S}{S} + \left(\frac{\mathrm{d} X}{X} \right)\left( \frac{\mathrm{d} S}{S}\right)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
= (q+\rho\sigma_x\sigma_s)\,\mathrm{d} t+\frac{\mathrm{d} X}{X} + \frac{\mathrm{d} S}{S}\;.
\]</span> Similarly, the rate of return on the foreign risk-free asset is <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathrm{d} (\mathrm{e}^{r_ft}X)}{\mathrm{e}^{r_ft}X} = r_f\,\mathrm{d} t + \frac{\mathrm{d} X}{X}\;,
\]</span> and of course the rate of return on the domestic risk-free asset is <span class="math inline">\(r\,\mathrm{d} t\)</span>. Therefore, the change in the value of the portfolio will be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathrm{d} W = a\left[(q+\rho\sigma_x\sigma_s)\,\mathrm{d} t+\frac{\mathrm{d} X}{X} + \frac{\mathrm{d} S}{S}\right] + b\left[r_f\,\mathrm{d} t + \frac{\mathrm{d} X}{X}\right] + cr\,\mathrm{d} t
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
=( aq+a\rho\sigma_x\sigma_s + br_f+cr)\,\mathrm{d} t +  (a+b)\frac{\mathrm{d} X}{X} +a \frac{\mathrm{d} S}{S}\; .
\]</span> The change <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto6</span> of the portfolio value will match the change <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto5</span> of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> if and only if <span class="math display">\[
a= V, \qquad b= -V, \qquad c = V\;.

<p>From our analysis at the end of <a href="#sec-s_currencyforwards"><span>Section&nbsp;6.4</span></a>, we know that the foreign risk-free asset in this replicating strategy can be replaced by currency forwards. The strategy here involves borrowing at the foreign risk-free rate, so we should replace long by short in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-mmhedge</span>. Borrowing <span class="math inline">\(V(t)\)</span> units of domestic currency means borrowing <span class="math inline">\(V(t)/X(t)\)</span> units of the foreign currency. Therefore, <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-mmhedge</span> gives us:</p>

<p>An equivalent strategy for replicating the payoff <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S(T)\)</span> at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is to invest <span class="math inline">\(V(t)\)</span> units of domestic currency in the foreign asset and to be short <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{r_f(T-t)}V(t)/X(t)\)</span> currency forwards at date~<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the beginning of the previous section, we noted that an investor who wants to bet on a foreign asset but does not want the exchange rate exposure could simply buy the asset and sell the currency forward. This shows how much of the asset he should buy and how much currency he should sell forward.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this strategy involves continuously buying and selling forwards, just as it involves continuously trading the foreign asset. Buying at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> a forward contract sold at date <span class="math inline">\(s&lt;t\)</span> cancels the delivery obligation on the contract sold at <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and leaves a cash flow of <span class="math inline">\(F(s)-F(t)\)</span> to be paid/received at the maturity date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Therefore, the strategy accumulates a liability or asset, depending on the direction the forward price moves, to be received at <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. On the other hand, maintaining an investment of <span class="math inline">\(V(t)\)</span> in the foreign asset will generate cash flows as the asset is sold or purchased over time. As <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto4</span> shows, whether it is sold or purchased depends on the direction the exchange rate moves. These cash flows should be invested or borrowed at the domestic risk-free rate. Thus, there is a liability or asset to be received at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> that is not shown in the boxed statement immediately above, and there is an investment or liability in the domestic risk-free asset that is not shown. It can be demonstrated that these cancel each other: if profits are made from trading forwards, then they (more precisely, their present value) will be consumed by the cost of buying the foreign asset, and vice versa. Hedging with forwards (and with futures) is considered in more detail in <a href="Chapter7.html#sec-s_hedgingforwards"><span>Section&nbsp;7.10</span></a>.</p>
<p>In this section, we consider a contract similar to that of the previous section, except that it is a pure forward, meaning that the payment for the contract occurs at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We maintain all of the assumptions of the previous section. The payment at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is in domestic currency, and we define the quanto forward price in units of domestic currency. Specifically, a long quanto forward contract, initiated at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and maturing at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and initiated at the forward price <span class="math inline">\(F^*(t)\)</span> will pay <span class="math display">\[\bar{X}S(T)-F^*(t)\]</span> at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The forward price <span class="math inline">\(F^*(t)\)</span> should be the price that makes this contract have a value of 0 at date <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>We already know how to replicate the underlying payoff <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S(T)\)</span> of the forward contract at the cost <span class="math inline">\(V(t)\)</span> defined in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto2</span>. Thus, the synthetic quanto forward is to purchase the replicating strategy and to borrow the cost <span class="math inline">\(V(t)\)</span> at the domestic risk-free rate. This leads to the liability <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{r(T-t)}V(t)\)</span> at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Therefore, we have:</p>

</div>
<p>Notice that borrowing <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in domestic currency to finance the replicating strategy of the previous section — i.e., the domestic currency investments described in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto7</span> — means eliminating the domestic risk-free investment <span class="math inline">\(c=V\)</span> required in the previous section. The replicating strategy for the quanto forward is simply to invest <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in the foreign asset and to finance the investment entirely by borrowing at the foreign risk-free rate. As in the previous section, borrowing at the foreign risk-free rate can be replaced by borrowing at the domestic risk-free rate and selling currency forwards.</p>
<p>Consider now a European call option on a foreign asset, with strike <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> set in the domestic currency and the value of the foreign asset being converted to domestic currency at a fixed exchange rate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span>. This is called a quanto call. We maintain all the assumptions of the previous two sections.</p>
<p>The value of the quanto call at maturity is <span class="math inline">\(\max(0, \bar{X}S(T)-K)\)</span>. To value this, we make use of what we learned in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?sec-s_quantos</span>. Namely, the portfolio with value <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> defined in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto2</span> replicates the payoff <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S(T)\)</span>: in each state of the world, <span class="math inline">\(V(T) = \bar{X}S(T)\)</span>. Therefore, the quanto call is equivalent to a standard European call on the portfolio with domestic currency price <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. The value is therefore given by the Black-Scholes formula. From the formula <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto21</span> for the dynamics of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, we see that the volatility of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the same as that of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>; therefore, we should input <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_s\)</span> as the volatility in the Black-Scholes formula. Furthermore, the portfolio <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is non-dividend-paying (it is the value of a claim to <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S(T)\)</span> at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> with no interim cash flows), so the dividend rate in the Black-Scholes formula should be zero. Thus, we have:</p>

<p>We can hedge a written quanto call the same way we hedge a written ordinary call: we buy delta shares of the underlying and borrow the difference between the cost of the delta shares and the option value. However, for the quanto call, the underlying should be regarded as the portfolio with value~<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> described in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?sec-s_quantos</span>. This portfolio consists of investing <span class="math inline">\(V(0)\)</span> units of domestic currency in the foreign asset, borrowing the same amount at the foreign risk-free rate, and investing <span class="math inline">\(V(0)\)</span> units of domestic currency in the domestic risk-free asset. The delta of the call is <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N}(d_1)\)</span>, so the hedge consists of investing <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N}(d_1)V(0)\)</span> units of domestic currency in the foreign asset, borrowing the same amount at the foreign risk-free rate, and investing <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N}(d_1)V(0)\)</span> in the domestic risk-free asset.

Thus, the net investment in the domestic risk-free asset is <span class="math display">\[\mathrm{N}(d_1)V(0) - \mathrm{e}^{-rT}K\mathrm{N}(d_2)\; ,\]</span> which is just the value of the option.

<p>There are many types and applications of return swaps, but here is one important example that involves the concepts discussed in this chapter. Suppose an investor wants to receive at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> the difference in the rates of return of two assets that are denominated in different currencies. The return will be calculated on a given notional principal. For example, an investor may want to receive at the end of a year the Nikkei rate of return minus the rate of return on the S&amp;P 500, calculated on a $1 million notional principal. If the Nikkei earns 15% over the year and the S&amp;P earns 10%, then the payment to the investor is 5% of $1 million. If the reverse happens—the Nikkei earns 10% and the S&amp;P earns 15%—then the investor must pay 5% of $1 million to the counterparty.</p>
<p>To model this, let <span class="math inline">\(S_f\)</span> denote the price of a foreign asset and <span class="math inline">\(S_d\)</span> the price of a domestic asset. Assume they have constant dividend yields <span class="math inline">\(q_f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q_d\)</span>. If the returns are calculated excluding dividends, as is likely to be the case, then the payment to the investor is <span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{S_f(T)-S_f(0)}{S_f(0)} - \frac{S_d(T)-S_d(0)}{S_d(0)}\right)  A = \left(\frac{S_f(T)}{S_f(0)} - \frac{S_d(T)}{S_d(0)}\right)  A\; ,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> denotes the notional principal. Of course, the investor may want the reverse swap, and we consider this particular case only for concreteness.</p>
<p>The swap may have nonzero market value at date 0, which means that some payment will have to be made upfront. To eliminate this, we can add a swap spread into the contract, affecting the cash flow at date~<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. This is a constant number <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> (which may be positive or negative), and including it changes the payment to the investor to <span class="math display">\[
\left(a+\frac{S_f(T)}{S_f(0)} - \frac{S_d(T)}{S_d(0)}\right)  A\;.
\]</span> The question we will address here is: what is the fair swap spread; i.e., for what number~<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> does the cash flow <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-returnswap1</span> have zero market value at date 0?</p>
<p>If the value is zero, then it is zero for any notional principal <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, so we can conveniently take <span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>. The cash flow consists of three pieces, all of which are to be received/paid at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>: the constant <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, the gross return on the foreign asset, and the gross return on the domestic asset. The value at date 0 of receiving <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> units of domestic currency is obviously <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-rT}a\)</span>. As we have observed several times before, the value at date 0 of receiving <span class="math inline">\(S_d(T)\)</span> units of domestic currency at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-q_d t}S_d(0)\)</span>, because this is the cost of enough shares to accumulate to one share at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> via reinvestment of dividends. Therefore, the value at date 0 of receiving <span class="math inline">\(S_d(T)/S_d(0)\)</span> at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{-q_dT}S_d(0)/S_d(0) = \mathrm{e}^{-q_dT}\)</span>.</p>
<p>What remains is to calculate the value of receiving <span class="math inline">\(S_f(T)/S_f(0)\)</span> units of domestic currency at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We can do this by interpreting <span class="math inline">\(1/S_f(0)\)</span> as the fixed exchange rate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}\)</span> in the definition of a quanto.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> We need to assume as before that the foreign asset price <span class="math inline">\(S_f\)</span> and the exchange rate have constant volatilities and a constant correlation. Denoting the volatilities by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x\)</span> and the correlation by <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> as before, equation~<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-quanto1</span> shows that the value of receiving <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}S_f(T) = S_f(T)/S_f(0)\)</span> units of domestic currency at date <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\exp\left\{(r_f - r-q_f-\rho\sigma_x\sigma_s)T\right\}\; .\]</span> Adding up the pieces, the value at date 0 of the cash flow <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-returnswap1</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>) is <span class="math display">\[\mathrm{e}^{-rT}a + \exp\left\{(r_f - r-q_f-\rho\sigma_x\sigma_s)T\right\} - \mathrm{e}^{-q_dT}\; ,\]</span> so we conclude:</p>

<p>When we use numerical methods to value American and path-dependent options, as in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?sec-c_introcomputation</span>, we typically focus on the dynamics of asset prices under the risk-neutral measure. To apply these results to currency options or options on foreign assets, we need to know the dynamics of the exchange rate under the risk-neutral measure. Because we can view the exchange rate as the domestic price of an asset with the foreign risk-free rate <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span> being its dividend yield, we have already calculated these dynamics in equation~<a href="Chapter2.html#eq-riskneutral11">Equation&nbsp;<span>2.31</span></a> of <a href="Chapter2.html#sec-s_girsanov"><span>Section&nbsp;2.9</span></a>.

<p>This equation has an interesting interpretation in terms of uncovered interest parity, which is the theory that differences in interest rates across currencies will be offset on average by appreciation/depreciation of the currencies. In other words, it is the theory that the strategy of borrowing in low-interest-rate currencies to invest in high-interest-rate currencies will not earn money on average because of depreciation of the high-interest-rate currency relative to the low-interest-rate currency. It is well known that this theory is not always true in reality. However, equation~<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-uncoveredparity</span> shows that it is true when we calculate expectations using the risk-neutral measure.</p>
<p>To see the interpretation of equation~<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-uncoveredparity</span> as uncovered interest parity, suppose that the foreign interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span> is lower than the domestic rate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. Then one may be tempted to borrow at the foreign rate and invest at the domestic rate. This would create a short position in the foreign currency. Equation <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?eq-uncoveredparity</span> states that the exchange rate is expected (under the risk-neutral measure) to appreciate at the rate <span class="math inline">\(r-r_f\)</span>; thus, repayment of the foreign currency will be more expensive in terms of domestic currency, offsetting the interest rate differential.</p>
