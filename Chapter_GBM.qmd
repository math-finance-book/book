An important Ito process is geometric Brownian motion given by
$$
S_t=S_0\e^{(\mu- \sigma^2 /2)t + \sigma B_t}
$$ {#eq-exponential1}

for constants $\mu$ and $\sigma$, where $B$ is a Brownian motion.  Using the product rule and the rule for exponentials, we obtain
$$
\frac{\d  S}{S} = \mu\d   t+\sigma\d   B\;.
$$ {#eq-Y}

When we see an equation of the form @eq-Y, we should recognize @eq-exponential1 as the solution. 

The process $S$ is called a geometric Brownian motion.  \index{geometric Brownian motion} In keeping with the discussion of @sec-s:itoprocesses, we interpret @eq-Y as stating that $\mu\d   t$ is the expected rate of change of $S$ and $\sigma^2\d   t$ is the variance of the rate of change in an instant $\d  t$.  We call $\mu$ the drift and $\sigma$ the volatility.  \index{volatility} 

Taking the natural logarithm of @eq-exponential1 gives an equivalent form of the solution:
$$
\log S_t= \log S_0+\left(\mu -\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)t + \sigma B_t\;.
$$ {#eq-exponential2}
  This shows that $\log S_t - \log S_0$ is a $(\mu-\sigma^2/2,\sigma)$--Brownian motion.  Given information at time $t$, the logarithm of $S(u)$ for $u>t$ is normally \index{lognormal distribution}distributed with mean $(u-t)(\mu-\sigma^2/2)$ and variance $(u-t)\sigma^2$.  Because $S$ is the exponential of its logarithm, $S$ can never be negative.  For this reason, a geometric Brownian motion is a better model for stock prices than is a Brownian motion.

The differential of @eq-exponential2 is
$$
\d  \log S_t = \left(\mu -\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)\d   t+ \sigma\d   B_t\;.
$$ {#eq-exponential3}

We conclude:

::: Rule

The  equation 
$$\frac{\d  S}{S} = \mu\d   t+\sigma\d   B$$
is equivalent to the equation
$$\d  \log S = \left(\mu -\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)\d   t+ \sigma\d   B\; .$$
The solution of both equations is @eq-exponential1 or the equivalent @eq-exponential2.

:::

In what follows, we describe some important properties of geometric Brownian motions.  The last two sections of the chapter address processes satisfying @eq-Y when $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are not constant. 

## Lognormal Variables and Average Growth Rates

A random variable is said to be lognormally distributed if it can be written as $\tilde{y}=  \e^{\tilde{x}}$ where $\tilde{x}$ has a normal distribution with mean $m$ and standard deviation $s$.  The mean of a lognormal random variable is given by the following.

::: Rule

##
If $\tilde{x}$ is normally distributed with mean $m$ and standard deviation $s$, then $\e^{\tilde{x}}$ is lognormally distributed and
$$\E[\e^{\tilde{x}}]=e^{m + \frac{1}{2} s^2}\,.
$$ {#eq-lognormal}


:::

@eq-exponential1 shows that if $S$ is a geometric Brownian motion, then, for each $t<u$, 
$$\frac{S_u}{S_t} = \e^{(\mu-\sigma^2/2)(u-t) + \sigma(B_u-B_t)}\,,$$
which is a lognormally distributed random variable, conditional on information at $t$.  We can apply the previous calculation rule by taking $m=(\mu-\sigma^2/2)(u-t)$ and $s=\sigma\sqrt{u-t}$.  This produces
$$\E_t[S_u] = S_t\e^{(u-t)\mu}\,.$$
Thus, a geometric Brownian motion grows at the average rate of $\mu$.

A special case is $\mu=0$.  When $\mu=0$, we have $\E_t[S_u]=S_t$, so $S$ is a martingale.  This is an important example of a strictly positive martingale.  

## Distribution of Continuously Compounded Returns

Over a discrete time interval $\Delta t$, @eq-exponential3 implies that the change in the logarithm of $S$ is 
$$
\Delta \log S = \left(\mu -\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right)\Delta t+ \sigma\,\Delta B\;.
$$ {#eq-exponential11}

If $S$ is the price of a dividend-reinvested asset, then over the time period $t_{i-1}$ to $t_i$, with $t_i-t_{i-1}=\Delta t$, we have
$$
\Delta \log S = r_i\,\Delta t\;,
$$ {#eq-exponential10}

where $r_i$ is the  continuously compounded annualized rate of return \index{continuously compounded return} during the period $\Delta t$.  This follows from the definition of the continuously compounded rate of return as the constant rate over the time period $\Delta t$ that would cause $S$ to grow (or fall) from $S_{t_{i-1}}$ to $S_{t_i}$.  To be precise, $r_i$ is defined by
$$\frac{S_{t_i}}{S_{t_{i-1}}} = \mathrm{e}^{r_i\Delta t}\; ,$$
which is equivalent to @eq-exponential10.
Thus, when a dividend-reinvested asset price is a geometric Brownian motions satisfying @eq-Y, then the continuously compounded annualized rate of return over a period of length $\Delta t$ is $$r_i = \mu -\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2+ \frac{\sigma\Delta B}{\Delta t}\; .$$
This implies that $r_i$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu-\sigma^2/2$ and variance $\sigma^2/\Delta t$.  Given historical data on the rates of return, the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ can be estimated by standard methods (see @sec-c:stochasticvolatility).


## Tail Probabilities of Geometric Brownian Motions {#sec-tailprobs}

An important calculation for pricing options is to compute the probability of an option finishing in the money under different probability measures.  Consider computing the probability at date $0<t$ of the event that $S_t > K$ for some positive constant $K$, where $S$ is a geometric Brownian motion satisfying @eq-Y.   We use the logarithmic version of the solution given in @eq-exponential2.  We have
$$\begin{align*}
S_t > K  & \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \log S_t > \log K\\
&
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \sigma B_t > \log K - \log S_0-\mu t
 \\
&
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \frac{B_t}{\sqrt{t}} > \frac{\log K - \log S_0-\mu t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}
\\
&
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad -\frac{B_t}{\sqrt{t}} < \frac{\log S_0-\log K + \mu t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}
 \end{align*}
$$ {#eq-tailprob2}
We denote the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than some number $d$ as $\mathrm{N}(d)$.  Because $-B_t / \sqrt{t}$ is a standard normal random variable, the above calculations imply the following.

::: Rule
## 
Assume $S$ is a geometric Brownian motion satisfying @eq-Y$.  Then, for any positive number $K$
$$
\text{prob}(S_t>K) = \mathrm{N}(d)\;,
$$ {#eq-tailprob01}

where
$$
d = \frac{\log S_0 - \log K+ \mu t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}\;.
$$ {#eq-tailprob3}
Furthermore,
$$
\text{prob}(S_t<K) = 1 - \mathrm{N}(d) = \mathrm{N}(-d)\;.
$$ {#eq-tailprob011}
:::

## Non-Constant Coefficients

If $\d S/S = \mu \d t + \sigma \d B$ but $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are not constants, then $S$ is not called a geometric Brownian motion.  However, we can solve this equation using arguments similar to those used at the beginning of this chapter.  We obtain
$$S_t = S_0 \exp\left(\int_0^t (\mu_s - \sigma_s^2/2)\,\d s + \int_0^t \sigma_s\d B_s\right)\,,$$
and 
$$\log S_t = \log S_0 + \int_0^t (\mu_s - \sigma_s^2/2)\,\d s + \int_0^t \sigma_s\d B_s\,.$$

## Volatilities of Products and Ratios  {#sec-s:volatilities}

We sometimes need to know the volatility of an Ito process $S$ formed as a ratio or product of two Ito processes $S_i$, given that
$$\frac{\d S_i}{S_i} = \mu_i\d t + \sigma \d B_i$$
for Brownian motions $B_1$ and $B_2$.  Here, we allow $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ to be stochastic processes, so the $S_i$ are not necessarily geometric Brownian motions.  Let $\rho$ denote the correlation process of the Brownian motions $B_1$ and $B_2$.  
As mentioned in @sec-s:geometricbrownianmotion, when we encounter an equation of the form 
$$\frac{\d  S}{S} = \mu\d   t + \sigma\d   B$$
where $B$ is a Brownian motion, we will say  $\sigma$ is the volatility of $S$.   We will occasionally need to compute the volatilities of products or ratios of random processes.  These computations follow directly from Ito's formula.

Suppose 
$$\frac{\d  X}{X} = \mu_x\d   t + \sigma_x\d   B_x \qquad \text{and} \qquad 
\frac{\d  Y}{Y} = \mu_y\d   t + \sigma_y\d   B_y\; ,$$
where $B_x$ and $B_y$ are Brownian motions with correlation $\rho$, and $\mu_x$, $\mu_y$, $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\rho$ may be quite general random processes.  

### Products
If $Z=XY$, then @eq-rule2 gives us
$$
\frac{\d  Z}{Z} = (\mu_x+\mu_y+\rho\sigma_x\sigma_y)\d   t + \sigma_x\d   B_x + \sigma_y\d   B_y\;.
$$ {#eq-volproduct1}

The instantaneous variance of $\d  Z/Z$ is calculated, using the rules for products of differentials, as
\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{\d  Z}{Z}\right)^2 &= (\sigma_x\d   B_x + \sigma_y\d   B_y)^2\\
&= (\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + 2\rho\sigma_x\sigma_y)\d   t\;.
\end{align*}
As will be explained below, the volatility is the square root of the instantaneous variance (dropping the $\d  t$).  This implies:

::: Rule
## 
The volatility of $XY$ is
$$
\sqrt{\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + 2\rho\sigma_x\sigma_y}\;.
$$ {#eq-volatilityproduct}

:::



### Ratios
If $Z=Y/X$, then @eq-rule4 gives us
$$
\frac{\d  Z}{Z} = (\mu_y-\mu_x-\rho\sigma_x\sigma_y+\sigma_x^2)\d   t + \sigma_y\d   B_y - \sigma_x\d   B_x\;.
$$ {#eq-ratioproduct1}

The instantaneous variance of $\d  Z/Z$ is therefore
\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{\d  Z}{Z}\right)^2 &= (\sigma_y\d   B_y - \sigma_x\d   B_x)^2\\
&= (\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 - 2\rho\sigma_x\sigma_y)\d   t\;.
\end{align*}
This implies:

::: Rule
## 
The volatility of $Y/X$ is  
$$
\sqrt{\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 - 2\rho\sigma_x\sigma_y}\;.
$$ {#eq-volatilityratio}

:::



::: Extra
To understand why taking the square root of $(\d  Z/Z)^2$ (dropping the $\d  t$) gives the volatility, consider for example the product case $Z=XY$.  Define a random process $B$ by $B_0=0$ and 
$$
\d  B = \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma}\d   B_x + \frac{\sigma_y}{\sigma}\d   B_y\;,
$$ {#eq-foreign\d   B}

where $\sigma$ is the volatility defined in @eq-volatilityproduct.
Then we can write  @eq-volproduct1 as
$$
\frac{\d  Z}{Z} = \left(\mu_x +\mu_y+ \rho\sigma_x\sigma_y\right)\d   t + \sigma\d   B\;.$$ {#eq-volproduct2}

From the discussion in @sec-s:itoprocesses, we know that $B$ is a continuous martingale.  We can compute its quadratic variation from
\begin{align*}
(\d  B)^2 &= \left(\frac{\sigma_x\d   B_x + \sigma_s\d   B_s}{\sigma}\right)^2\\
&= \frac{(\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_s^2 + 2\rho\sigma_x\sigma_s)\d   t}{\sigma^2}\; ,\\
&= \d  t\;.
\end{align*}
By Levy's theorem (see @sec-s:quadraticvariation), any continuous martingale with this quadratic variation is necessarily a Brownian motion.  Therefore,  @eq-volproduct2 shows that $\sigma$ is the volatility of $Z$ as defined at the beginning of the section.
