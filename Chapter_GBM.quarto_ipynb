To see this, consider the portfolio starting with a single share of the asset and reinvesting dividends until some date $T$.  Let $X_t$ denote the number of shares resulting from this strategy at any time $t\\leq T$.  Then the dividend received at date $t$ is $q S_tX_t\\d   t$, which can be used to purchase $q X_t\\d   t$ new shares.
