## Stochastic Coefficients 

Some of our analysis, especially in the Stochastic Volatility and Fixed Income Chpaters, will require stochastic coefficients.  The risk free rate is locally risk free but can be stocastic.  In other words, the value of an investment in this asset follows 
$$\d R(t) = r_t R(t) \d t . $$
The riskless rate $r_t$ may be modelled as an Ito process.  The investment is locally riskfree since there is no $dB$ term.  The  explicit solution is 
$$R(t)= R(0) \exp\left(\int_0^t r_s ds\right). $$
Correspondingly, we can write the risky asset price as
$$ \d S(t) = \mu_t S(t) \d t + \sigma_t S(t) \d B_t $$
where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ can also be modelled as Ito processes.  The explicit solution is 
$$ S(t)= S(0) \exp\left(\int_0^t \left(\mu_s - \frac{\sigma_s}{2} \right) \d s + \int_0^t \sigma_s \d B_s \right). $$
Importantly, this solution is nonnegative if $S(0)>0$.  More importantly, the prouct and ratio rules remain valid even when the coefficients are stochastic, although some regularity is required to ensure various integrals are defined.

## Reinvesting Dividends {#sec-s:reinvestingdividends}

Frequently, we will assume that the asset underlying a derivative security pays a constant dividend yield, \index{dividend yield} which we will denote by $q$.  This means, for an asset with price $S_t$, that the dividend in an instant $\d  t$ is $q S_t\d   t$.  If the dividends are reinvested in new shares, the number of shares will grow exponentially at rate $q$.  To see this, consider the portfolio starting with a single share of the asset and reinvesting dividends until some date $T$.  Let $X_t$ denote the number of shares resulting from this strategy at any time $t\leq T$.  Then the dividend received at date $t$ is $q S_tX_t\d   t$, which can be used to purchase $q X_t\d   t$ new shares.  This implies that $\d  X_t=q X_t\d   t$, or $\d  X_t/\d  t = q X_t$, and it is easy to check (and very well known) that this equation is solved by $X_t=\mathrm{e}^{q t}X_0$.  In our case, with $X_0=1$, we have $X_t=\mathrm{e}^{q t}$.

The dollar value of the trading strategy just described will be $X_tS_t = \mathrm{e}^{q t}S_t$.  Denote this by $V_t$.  This is the value of a dividend-reinvested portfolio, because all dividends are reinvested.  From Ito's Formula for compounding and discounting, we know that
$$ 
\frac{\d  V}{V} = q\d   t + \frac{\d  S}{S}\;.
$$ {#eq-reinvestingdividends}

This means that the rate of return on the portfolio is the dividend yield $q\d   t$ plus the return $\d  S/S$ due to capital gains.

## The Exponential Martingale


While geometric Brownian motion is an important stochastic process to model stock prices, the process with drift equal to zero given by
$$X_t = \exp\left(-\frac{\kappa^2}{2} + \kappa B_t\right)$$

satisfies $\E[X_t]=1$ and $\E[X_t|X_s]=X_s$ and is an important example of a strictly positive martingale.  Again, these facts can be verified using the formula for the expected value of a lognormal random variable.  Notice that we can write
$$\d   X_t= \kappa X_t \d   B_t\;,$$
which agrees with the martingale characterization of $\int_0^t \sigma(X_t,t) \d   B_t$.
