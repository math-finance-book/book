# Preface {.unnumbered}

::: {.ToDo .unnumbered}

- KB: simulated Ito expansion plot in Ito's Formula chapter should have m=1 and both plots in the same figure and should be converted to plotly.
- KB: left panel in interactive Ito Approximation should have legend inside the figure to avoid shrinking the figure
- KB: add code and plots to first section in Ito chapter 
- KB: write Girsanov's Theorem section in Girsanov chapter
- KB: move explanation of digitals and share digitals from Chapter 10 (Black-Scholes) to Chapter 4 (Digitals)
- KB: add code and plots to Monte Carlo and Binomial sections in Black-Scholes chapter.  
  - for Monte Carlo, only simulate $S_T$.
- KB: add import Black_Scholes_Call and uncomment lines in Asians and Other Exotics code blocks
- KB: check exercises in chapters that have been split into multiple parts
- KB: ubstitute root for bisection and multivariate_normal for binomial_prob 
- KB: convert plots to plotly
- KB: add imports of libraries in each code block
- KB: add discussions of approximations for Asians, baskets, and spreads in Asians chapter.
