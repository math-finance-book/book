More exotic options are studied in the following chapter.\n\n## Asian Options\n\nAn Asian option \\index{Asian option} \\index{average-price option} \\index{average-strike option} is an option the value of which depends on the average underlying asset price during the lifetime of the option.  Average-price calls and puts are defined like standard calls and puts but with the final asset price replaced by the average price.  Average-strike calls and puts are defined like standard calls and puts but with the exercise price replaced by the average asset price.   A firm that must purchase an input at frequent intervals or will sell a product in a foreign currency at frequent intervals can use an average price option as an alternative to buying multiple options with different maturity dates.  The average-price option will generally be both less expensive and a better hedge than purchasing multiple options.\n\nIn practice, the average price is computed by averaging over the prices sampled at a finite number of discrete dates.  First, we consider the case of continuous sampling.  With continuous sampling, the average price at date $T$ for an option written at date $0$ will be denoted by $A_T$ and is defined as\n$$\nA_T = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T S_t\\d   t\\; .\n$$\nTo obtain a closed-form solution for the value of an option on the average price, we face essentially the same problem as for basket and spread options:  a sum of lognormally distributed variables is not itself lognormally distributed.  In this case, the integral, which is essentially a continuous sum of the prices at different dates, is not lognormally distributed.  \n\nAn alternative contract would replace the average price with the geometric average.  \\index{geometric average} \\index{geometric-average option} This is defined as the exponential of the average logarithm.  We will denote this by $A_\\text{g}_T$.  The average logarithm is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\log S_t\\d   t\\; ,\n$$\nand the geometric average is\n$$\nA_\\text{g}_T = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\log S_t\\d   t\\right)\\; .\n$$\nThe concavity of the logarithm function guarantees that\n$$\n\\log \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T S_t > \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\log S_t\\d   t \\; .\n$$\nTherefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nA_T &= \\exp\\left(\\log \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T S_t\\right)\\\\\n&> \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\log S_t\\d   t\\right) \\\\\n&= A_\\text{g}_T\\; .\n\\end{align*}\nConsequently, approximating the value of an average-price or average-strike option by substituting $A_\\text{g}_T$ for $A_T$ will produce a biased estimate of the value.  Nevertheless, the geometric average$A_\\text{g}_T$ and the arithmetic average $A_T$ will be highly correlated, so $A_\\text{g}_T$ forms a very useful \\text{control variate} for Monte-Carlo valuation of average-price and average-strike options, as will be discussed later.  To implement the idea, we need a valuation formula for options written on $A_\\text{g}_T$.  We will derive this for an average-price call, in which $A_\\text{g}_T$ substitutes for $A_T$.\n\nSpecifically, consider a contract that pays\n$$\n\\max(0,A_\\text{g}_T-K)\n$$\nat its maturity $T$.\nThis is a geometric-average-price call,, and we will analyze it in the same way that we analyzed quanto options in @sec-c:foreignexchange.  Let $V_t$ denote the value at date $t$ of receiving $A_\\text{g}_T$ at date $T$.  This can be calculated, and the result will be given below.  $V_t$ is the value of a dividend-reinvested portfolio, and, by definition, $V_T=A_\\text{g}_T$, so the geometric-average-price call is equivalent to a standard call with $V$ being the price of the underlying.  We will show that $V$ has a time-varying but non-random volatility.  Therefore, we can apply the Black-Scholes formula, inputting the average volatility as described in @sec-s:timevaryingvolatility, to value the geometric-average-price call.  We could attempt the same route to price average-price options, but we would find that the volatility of the corresponding value $V$ would vary randomly, just as we found the basket portfolio to have a random volatility in the previous section.\n\nThe value $V_t$ can be calculated as\n$$\nV_t= \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}\\\\E^R_t\\big[A_\\text{g}_T\\big]\\; .\n$$\nDefine\n$$\nA_g_t = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\int_0^t \\log S(u)\\,du\\right)\\;.\n$$\n\nWe will verify at the end of this section that\n$$\nV_t = \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}A_g_t^{\\frac{t}{T}}S_t^{\\frac{T-t}{T}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{(r-q-\\sigma^2/2)(T-t)^2}{2T} + \\frac{\\sigma^2(T-t)^3}{6T^2}\\right)\\;.\n$$ {#eq-geometricaveragev1}\n\nTwo points are noteworthy.  First, the value at date $0$ is\n\n$$\nV_0 = \\mathrm{e}^{-rT}S_0\\exp\\left(\\frac{(r-q-\\sigma^2/2)T}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma^2T}{6}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n=\\exp\\left(-\\frac{6r+6q + \\sigma^2}{12}T\\right)S_0\\;.\n$$ {#eq-asianV0}\n\n\nSecond, the volatility comes from the factor\n$$\nS_t^{\\frac{T-t}{T}}\\;,\n$$\nand, by Ito's formula,\n$$\n\\frac{ \\d  S^{\\frac{T-t}{T}}}{S^{\\frac{T-t}{T}}} = \\text{something}\\d    t + \\left(\\frac{T-t}{T}\\right)\\sigma\\d   B\\;.\n$$\nThis implies that the average volatility, in the sense of @sec-s:timevaryingvolatility, is\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{avg}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\left(\\frac{T-t}{T}\\right)^2\\sigma^2\\d   t}\n=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{3}}\\;.\n$$\nApplying the Black-Scholes formula yields:\n\n::: Rule\n## \n\nThe value at date $0$ of a continuously-sampled geometric-average-price call written at date $0$ and having $T$ years to maturity is \n$$\nV_0\\mathrm{N}(d_1)-\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K\\mathrm{N}(d_2)\\; ,\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nd_1 = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{V_0}{K}\\right)+\\left(r+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}^2\\right)T}{\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}\\sqrt{T}}, \\qquad d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma_{\\text{avg}}\\sqrt{T}\\; ,\n$$\n$V_0$ is defined in @eq-asianV0, and $\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}=\\sigma/\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n:::\n\n\nWe can also value a discretely-sampled geometric-average-price call by the same arguments.  Consider dates $0<t_0< t_1 < \\cdots t_N=T$, where $t_i-t_{i-1}=\\Delta t$ for each $i$ and suppose the price is to be sampled  at the dates $t_1,\\ldots,t_N$.  Now let $V_t$ denote the value at date $t$ of the contract that pays\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log S_{t_i}\\right) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^N S_{t_i}\\right)^{1/N}\n$$ {#eq-geometricaveragev0}\n\nat date $T$.  The call option will pay $\\max(0,V_T-K)$ at date $T$.  Let $k$ denote the integer such that $t_{N-k-1} \\leq t < t_{N-k}$.  This means that we have already observed the prices $S(t_1), \\ldots, S(t_{N-k-1})$ and we have yet to observe the $k+1$ prices $S(t_{N-k}), \\ldots ,S(t_N)$.  Define $\\varepsilon = (t_{N\\!-k}-t)/\\Delta t$, which is fraction of the interval $\\Delta t$ that must pass before we reach the next sampling date $t_{N\\!-k}$.  We will show at the end of this section that \n\n$$\n\\begin{multline}\nV_t = \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}S_t^{\\frac{k+1}{N}}\\prod_{i=1}^{N-k-1}S_{t_i}^{\\frac{1}{N}}\\\\\n\\times\\,\\exp\\left(\\left[ \\frac{(k+1)\\varepsilon\\nu}{N}\\!+\\! \\frac{k(k+1)\\nu}{2N}\\! +\\! \\frac{(k+1)^2\\sigma^2\\varepsilon}{2N^2}\\!+\\!\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)\\sigma^2}{12N^2} \\right]\\Delta t\\right)\\;,\n\\end{multline}\n$$ {#eq-geometricaveragev2}\n\nwhere $\\nu = r-q-\\sigma^2/2$\n\nAgain, two points are noteworthy.  Assume the call was written at date $0$ and the first observation date $t_1$ is $\\Delta t$ years away.  Then, we have $k+1=N$ and $\\varepsilon=1$ so\n$$\nV_0 = \\mathrm{e}^{-rT}S_0\\exp\\left( \\frac{(N+1)\\nu\\Delta t}{2} + \\frac{(N+1)(2N+1)\\sigma^2\\Delta t}{12N} \\right)\\;.\n$$ {#eq-asianV02}\n\nSecond, the volatility of $V_t$ comes from the factor $S_t^{(k+1)/N}$, and\n$$\n\\frac{ \\d  S^{\\frac{k+1}{N}}}{S^{\\frac{k+1}{N}}} = \\text{something}\\d    t + \\left(\\frac{k+1}{N}\\right)\\sigma\\d   B\\;.\n$$\nThis implies that the average volatility, in the sense of @sec-s:timevaryingvolatility, is\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{avg}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\left(\\frac{k+1}{N}\\right)^2\\sigma^2\\d   t}\n$$\n$$\n=\\frac{\\sigma}{N^{3/2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}}\\;,\n$$ {#eq-asiansigmaavg}\n\n\nwhere we have used the fact that $\\sum_{i=1}^N i^2 = N(N+1)(2N+1)/6$ to obtain the second equality.\nThus, the Black-Scholes formula implies:\n\n::: Rule\n## \n\nThe value at date $0$ of a discretely-sampled geometric-average-price call written at date $0$ and having $T$ years to maturity is \n$$\nV_0\\mathrm{N}(d_1)-\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K\\mathrm{N}(d_2)\\;,\n$$ {#eq-disc_geom_avg_call}\n\nwhere\n$$\nd_1 = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{V_0}{K}\\right)+\\left(r+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}^2\\right)T}{\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}\\sqrt{T}}, \\qquad d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma_{\\text{avg}}\\sqrt{T}\\; ,\n$$\n$V_0$ is defined in @eq-asianV02,\nand $\\sigma_{\\text{avg}}$ is defined in @eq-asiansigmaavg.\n\n:::\n\nThis formula will be used in @sec-s:controlvariates as a control variate for pricing discretely-sampled average-price calls (even average-price calls that were written before the date of valuation).\n\n::: Extra\n ## \n\nWe will now derive @eq-geometricaveragev1 and @eq-geometricaveragev2.  We will begin with @eq-geometricaveragev1.\nThe random variable $A_g_T$  is normally distributed under the risk-neutral probability given information at time $t$.  To establish this, and to calculate the mean and variance of $A_g_T$, the key is to change the order of integration in the integral in the second line below to obtain the third line:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_t^T \\log S(u)\\,du &= \\int_t^T \\left\\{\\log S_t + \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)(u-t) + \\sigma [B(u)-B_t]\\right\\}\\,du\\\\\n&= (T-t)\\log S_t + \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\frac{(T-t)^2}{2} + \\sigma\\int_t^T \\int_t^u \\d  B_s\\,du\\\\\n&= (T-t)\\log S_t + \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\frac{(T-t)^2}{2} + \\sigma\\int_t^T \\int_s^T du\\d   B_s\\\\\n&= (T-t)\\log S_t + \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\frac{(T-t)^2}{2} + \\sigma\\int_t^T (T-s)\\d   B_s\n\\end{align*}\nand then to note that $\\int_t^T (T-s)\\d   B_s$ is normally distributed with mean zero and variance equal to \n$$\n\\int_t^T (T-s)^2\\,ds =\\frac{(T-t)^3}{3}\\;.\n$$\nTherefore $\\\\E^R_t\\left[A_g_T\\right]$ is the expectation of the exponential of a normally distributed random variable.  Equation~@eq-geometricaveragev1 now follows from the fact that if $x$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ then $\\\\E\\left[\\mathrm{e}^x\\right] = \\mathrm{e}^{\\mu+\\sigma^2/2}$.  \n\n\nTo establish @eq-geometricaveragev2, note that the discounted risk-neutral expectation of @eq-geometricaveragev0, conditional on having observed $S(t_1), \\ldots, S(t_{N-k-1})$, is\n\n$$\nV_t = \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}\\\\E^R_t \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log S_{t_i}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N-k-1} \\log S_{t_i}\\right)\\times \\\\E^R_t \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=N-k}^N \\log S_{t_i}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\n=\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{N-k-1}S_{t_i}^{\\frac{1}{N}}\\right)\\times \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}\\\\E^R_t \\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=N-k}^N \\log S_{t_i}\\right)\\right]\\;.\n$$ {#eq-geometricaveragev3}\n\n\nLet  $\\Delta_0B = B(t_{N-k})-B_t$ and $\\Delta_iB = B(t_{N\\!-k+i})-B(t_{N\\!-k+i-1})$ for $i \\geq 1$.  We can write the sum of logarithms inside the expectation above as\n\\begin{multline*}\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k}\\big\\{[\\log S_t + (t_{N-k+i}-t)\\nu + \\sigma [B(t_{N-k+i})-B_t]\\big\\}\\\\\n=(k+1)\\log S_t + \\sum_{i=0}^{k} (\\varepsilon + i)\\nu\\Delta t + \\sigma\\sum_{i=0}^{k} [\\Delta_0B + \\Delta_1B + \\cdots + \\Delta_iB] \\\\\n=(k+1)\\log S_t + (k+1)\\varepsilon\\nu\\Delta t + \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\nu\\Delta t + \\sigma\\sum_{i=0}^{k} (k+1-i)\\Delta_iB\\;,\n\\end{multline*}\nwhere to obtain the last equality we used the fact that $\\sum_{i=0}^k i = k(k+1)/2$.\nThe random variables $\\Delta_iB$ are normally distributed with mean zero and variance $\\Delta t$ (the variance is $\\varepsilon \\Delta t$ for $i=0$).  Thus, the sum of logarithms is\n a normally distributed random variable with mean\n$$\n(k+1)\\log S_t + (k+1)\\varepsilon\\nu\\Delta t + \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\nu\\Delta t\n$$\nand variance\n$$\n(k+1)^2\\sigma^2\\varepsilon\\Delta t + \\sigma^2\\sum_{i=1}^{k} (k+1-i)^2\\Delta t = (k+1)^2\\sigma^2\\varepsilon\\Delta t +\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)\\sigma^2}{6}\\; ,\n$$\nusing the fact that $\\sum_{i=1}^k i^2 = k(k+1)(2k+1)/6$.\nThe expectation of the exponential of a normally distributed random variable equals the exponential of its mean plus one-half of its variance, and the exponential of $(k+1)\\log S_t/N$ is $S_t^{(k+1)/N}$.  Therefore the conditional expectation in @eq-geometricaveragev3 is\n$$S_t^{\\frac{k+1}{N}}\\exp\\left(\\left[ \\frac{(k+1)\\varepsilon\\nu}{N}+ \\frac{k(k+1)\\nu}{2N} + \\frac{(k+1)^2\\sigma^2\\varepsilon}{2N^2}+\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)\\sigma^2}{12N^2} \\right]\\Delta t\\right)\\; ,\n$$\nwhich implies @eq-geometricaveragev2.\n:::\n\nThe following code computes the price of a geometric-average-price call.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\n\"\"\"\ndef discrete_geom_average_price_call(S, K, r, sigma, q, T, N):\n    dt = T / N\n    nu = r - q - 0.5 * sigma ** 2\n    a = N * (N + 1) * (2 * N + 1) / 6\n    V = np.exp(-r * T) * S * np.exp(((N + 1) * nu / 2 + sigma ** 2 * a / (2 * N ** 2)) * dt)\n    sigavg = sigma * np.sqrt(a) / (N ** 1.5)\n    return black_scholes_call(V, K, r, sigavg, q, T)\n\nprint(\"Discrete Geometric Average Price Call:\", discrete_geom_average_price_call(S, K, r, sigma, q, T, N))\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n::: {#geometric_average_price_calls .cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```\n'\\ndef discrete_geom_average_price_call(S, K, r, sigma, q, T, N):\\n    dt = T / N\\n    nu = r - q - 0.5 * sigma ** 2\\n    a = N * (N + 1) * (2 * N + 1) / 6\\n    V = np.exp(-r * T) * S * np.exp(((N + 1) * nu / 2 + sigma ** 2 * a / (2 * N ** 2)) * dt)\\n    sigavg = sigma * np.sqrt(a) / (N ** 1.5)\\n    return black_scholes_call(V, K, r, sigavg, q, T)\\n\\nprint(\"Discrete Geometric Average Price Call:\", discrete_geom_average_price_call(S, K, r, sigma, q, T, N))\\n'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Basket Options\n\nA basket option is an option written on a portfolio of assets.  For example, someone may want to hedge the change in the value of the dollar relative to a basket of currencies.  A basket option is an alternative to purchasing separate options on each currency.  Generally, the basket option would have a lower premium than the separate options, because an option on a portfolio is cheaper (and pays less at maturity) than a portfolio of options.  \n\nLetting $S_1$, \\ldots, $S_n$ denote the asset prices and $w_1$, \\ldots, $w_n$ the weights specified by the contract, a basket call would pay\n$$\\max\\left(0,\\;\\sum_{i=1}^n w_iS_i_T - K\\right)$$\nat maturity $T$.  A spread option is actually a special case of a basket option, with $n=2$, $w_1=1$, and $w_2=-1$.  The difficulty in valuing basket options is the same as that encountered in valuing spread options.  The volatility of the basket price $\\sum_{i=1}^nw_iS_i_t$ will vary over time, depending on the relative volatilities of the assets and the price changes in the assets.  For example, consider the case $n=2$ and write $S_t$ for the basket price $w_1S_1_t+w_2S_2_t$.  Then\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\d  S}{S} &= \\frac{w_1\\d   S_1}{S} + \\frac{w_2\\d   S_2}{S}\\\\\n&=\\frac{w_1S_1}{S}\\times \\frac{\\d  S_1}{S_1} + \\frac{w_2S_2}{S}\\times \\frac{\\d  S_2}{S_2}\\;.\n\\end{align*}\nLet $x_i_t=w_iS_i_t/S_t$.  This is the fraction of the portfolio value that the $i$--th asset contributes.  It will vary randomly over time as the prices change.  Letting $\\sigma_i$ denote the volatilities of the individual assets and $\\rho$ their correlation, the formula just given for $\\d  S/S$ shows that the instantaneous volatility of the basket price at any date $t$ is\n$$\n\\sqrt{x_1^2_t\\sigma_1^2 + 2x_1_tx_2_t\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + x_2^2_t\\sigma_2^2}\\; .\n$$\n\nHence, the volatility will vary randomly over time as the $x_i$ change.  There is no simple closed-form solution for the value of a basket option.\n\n\n## Spread Options\n\nA spread option \\index{spread option} \\index{basket option} is a call or a put written on the difference of two asset prices.  For example, a spread call will pay at maturity $T$ the larger of zero and $S_1_T-S_2_T-K$, where the $S_i$ are the asset prices and $K$ is the strike price of the call.  Spread options can be used by producers to hedge the difference between an input price and an output price.  They are also useful for hedging basis risk.  For example, someone may want to hedge an asset by selling a futures contract on a closely related but not identical asset.  This exposes the hedger to basis risk: the difference in value between the asset and the underlying asset on the futures contract.  A spread call can hedge the basis risk: take $S_1$ to be the value of the asset underlying the futures contract and $S_2$ the value of the asset being hedged.\n\nA spread option is actually an exchange option.  Assuming constant dividend yields $q_1$ and $q_2$,  we can take the assets underlying the exchange option to be as follows\n\n \n1. At date $0$, purchase $\\mathrm{e}^{-q_1T}$ units of the asset with price $S_1$ and reinvest dividends, leading to a value of $S_1_T$ at date $T$, \n2. At date $0$, purchase $\\mathrm{e}^{-q_2T}$ units of the asset with price $S_2$ and invest $\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K$ in the risk-free asset.  Reinvesting dividends and accumulating interest means that we will have $S_2_T+K$ dollars at date $T$.\n\n\nHowever, we cannot apply Margrabe's formula to price spread options, because the second portfolio described above will have a stochastic volatility.  To see this, note that if the price $S_2_t$ falls to a low level, then the portfolio will consist primarily of the risk-free asset, so the portfolio volatility will be near the volatility of the risk-free asset, which is zero.  On the other hand, if $S_2_t$ becomes very high, then the portfolio will be weighted very heavily on the stock investment, and its volatility will approach the volatility of $S_2$.\n\n\n\n\n\n## {.unnumbered}\n\n::: Exercise\n Intuitively, the value of a forward-start call option should be lower the closer is the date $T$ at which the strike is set to the date $T'$ at which the option matures, because then the option has less time to maturity after being created at $T$.

As discussed in @sec-s:discrete, the value of a European call is given by the Black-Scholes formula with $S-\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}D$ being the initial asset price and $q=0$ being the constant dividend yield.  Use the function `American_Call_Dividend` to compute the value of an American call for dividends $D=.1S$, \\ldots $D=.9S$.

The stock is not expected to pay a dividend during the next two months.  Assuming the stock actually satisfies the Black-Scholes assumptions, find a formula for the minimum fee that you would require.  (Hint:  It is almost in @sec-s:lookbacks.)

Modify the simulations to compare the end-of-year costs including the costs of the options, adding interest on the option prices to put everything on an end-of-year basis.\n:::\n::: {#exr-e_standardknockout3}\n \nModify @exr-e_standardknockout by including a third hedge: a combination of a down-and-out call as in part (b) of @exr-e_standardknockout and a down-and-in call with knockout barrier and strike 10\\% below the current price of the asset.  Note that this combination forms a call option with strike that is reset when the underlying asset price hits a barrier.\n:::\n::: {#exr-e_standardknockout4}\n\nModify @exr-e_standardknockout2 by including the hedge in @exr-e_standardknockout3.  Value the down-and-in call using the function `Down_And_Out_Call` and the fact that a down-and-out and down-and-in with the same strikes and barriers form a standard option. \n:::\n::: {#exr-e_averagehedge}\n  Each week you purchase 100 units of an asset, and you want to hedge your total quarterly (13-week) cost.  Create a Python program simulating the asset price and comparing the quality of the following hedges: \n\n\n\n1. a standard European call maturing at the end of the quarter ($T=0.25$) on 1300 units of the asset, \n2. 13 call options maturing at the end of each week of the quarter, each written on 100 units of the asset, and \n3. a discretely sampled average-price call with maturity $T=0.25$ written on 1300 units of the asset, where the sampling is at the end of each week.  \n4. a discretely sampled geometric-average-price call with maturity $T=0.25$ written on 1300 units of the asset, where the sampling is at the end of each week.\n\n\nAllow the user to input $S$, $r$, $\\sigma$ and $q$.  Assume all of the options are at the money at the beginning of the quarter ($K=S$).  Compare the hedges as in @exr-e_standardknockout.\n:::\n::: {#exr-e_averagehedge2}\n In the setting of the previous problem, compute the prices of the options in parts (a), (b) and (d).  Modify the simulations in the previous problem to compare the end-of-quarter costs including the costs of the options (adding interest on the option prices to put everything on an end-of-quarter basis).\n:::\n::: Exercise\n Using the put-call parity relation, derive a formula for the value of a forward-start put.\n:::\n::: Exercise\n Derive @eq-callonaput for the value of a call on a put.\n:::\n::: Exercise\n Complete the derivation of @eq-chooser2 for the value of a chooser option.\n:::\n::: Exercise\n Derive a formula for the value of a put option on the maximum of two risky asset prices.\n:::\n::: Exercise\n Using the result of the preceding exercise and Margrabe's formula, verify that calls and puts (having the same strike $K$ and maturity $T$) on the maximum of two risky asset prices satisfy the following put-call parity relation:\n\\begin{multline*}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K + \\text{Value of call on max} \\\\\n= \\mathrm{e}^{-q_2T}S_2_0 + \\text{Value of option to exchange asset 2 for asset 1} \\\\+ \\text{Value of put on max}\\;.\n\\end{multline*}\n:::\n\n",
