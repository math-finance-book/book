Brownian motion given by\n$$\nS_t=S_0\\exp\\left(\\mu t- \\sigma^2 t/2 + \\sigma B_t\\right)\n$$ {#eq-exponential1}\nfor constants $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, where $B$ is a Brownian motion.  For each time $t$, the random variable $S_t$ in @eq-exponential1 is a lognormal random variable. Ito's formula for exponentials of Ito processes implies\n$$\n\\frac{\\d  S}{S} = \\mu\\d   t+\\sigma\\d   B\\;.\n$$ {#eq-Y}\nWhen we see an equation of the form @eq-Y, we should recognize @eq-exponential1 as the solution. \n\nThe process $S$ is called a geometric Brownian motion.  In keeping with the discussion of @sec-s:itoprocesses, we interpret @eq-Y as stating that $\\mu\\d   t$ is the expected rate of change of $S$ and $\\sigma^2\\d   t$ is the variance of the rate of change in an instant $\\d  t$.  We call $\\mu$ the drift and $\\sigma$ the volatility.  The geometric Brownian motion grows at the average rate of $\\mu$, in the sense that $\\E[S_t] = \\mathrm{e}^{\\mu t}S_0$.  This can be verified with the aid of @eq-lognormal.\n\nIf $\\mu=0$, then $\\E[S_t] = S_0$.  In fact, a geometric Brownian motion $S$ as in @eq-exponential1 and @eq-Y is a martingale when $\\mu=0$.  It is an example of what is called an exponential martingale.  An exponential is always positive, so an exponential martingale is always positive.\n \nTaking the natural logarithm of @eq-exponential1 gives an equivalent form of the solution:\n$$\n\\log S_t= \\log S_0+\\left(\\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\sigma B_t\\;.\n$$ {#eq-exponential2}\n  This shows that $\\log S_t - \\log S_0$ is a $(\\mu-\\sigma^2/2,\\sigma)$--Brownian motion.  Given information at time $t$, the logarithm of $S(u)$ for $u>t$ is normally \\index{lognormal distribution}distributed with mean $(u-t)(\\mu-\\sigma^2/2)$ and variance $(u-t)\\sigma^2$.  Because $S$ is the exponential of its logarithm, $S$ can never be negative.  For this reason, a geometric Brownian motion is a better model for stock prices than is a Brownian motion.  The differential of @eq-exponential2 is\n$$\n\\d  \\log S_t = \\left(\\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\d   t+ \\sigma\\d   B_t\\;.\n$$ {#eq-exponential3}\n\nWe can summarize this discussion as follows.\n\n::: Principle\nThe  equation \n$$\\frac{\\d  S}{S} = \\mu\\d   t+\\sigma\\d   B$$\nis equivalent to the equation\n$$\\d  \\log S = \\left(\\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\d   t+ \\sigma\\d   B\\; .$$\nThe solution of both equations is @eq-exponential1 or the equivalent @eq-exponential2.\n:::\n\nWe can simulate a path of a geometric Brownian motion $S$ by first simulating $\\log S$ and then computing the exponential.  We simulate the changes $\\Delta \\log S$ as normally distributed random variables with zero mean and variance equal to $\\sigma^2\\Delta t$.  We could also simulate the changes $\\Delta \\log S$ using a binomial model as in @sec-s:brownian_binomial.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-gbm-sim .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy

return $r$ over a time period of $\\Delta t$ years, the annualized continuously compounded return is defined to be the number $x$ such that $\\e^{x\\Delta t} = 1+r$; equivalently, $x = \\log(1+r) / \\Delta t$.  \nWe frequently take \"annualized\" for granted and just say \"continuously compounded return.\"  As an example, if you earn 1\\% in a month, then the continuously compounded return is $\\log (1.01) / (1/12) = 0.1194$.  The reason for the name \"continuously compounded\" is that compounding a monthly rate of interest of $0.1194/12$ $n$ times during a month produces a total return over the month of \n$$\\left(1 + \\frac{0.1194/12}{n}\\right)^ n - 1\\,,$$\nwhich converges to $0.01$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.  Thus, compounding an infinite number of times during a month at an annual rate of $0.1194$ (equal to a monthly rate of $0.1194/12$) is equivalent to the actual 1\\% return.^[ The reason for considering this concept is that compound returns like $(1+r_1)(1+r_2)$ are simpler to analyze in some contexts as $\\e^{x_1+x_2}$.]\n\nGiven a dividend-reinvested asset price $S$, the rate of return from date $t_1$ to $t_2$ is $S_{t_2}/S_{t_1} - 1$.  Denote this rate of return by $r$ and defined the corresponding continuously compounded return\n$$x = \\log(1+r) = \\log\\left(\\frac{S_{t_2}}{S_{t_1}}) = \\log S_{t_2} - \\log S_{t_1}\\,.$$\nUsing @eq-exponential3, we see that the continuously compounded return is \n$$\nx = \\left(\\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)(t_2-t_1)+ \\sigma\\,(B_{t_2} - B_{t_1})\\;.\n$$ {#eq-exponential11}\nThus, from the vantage point of date $t_1$, the continuously compounded return is normally distributed with mean\n$$\\left(\\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)$$\nand variance $\\sigma^2 \\Delta t$, where we define $\\Delta t = t_2-t_1$. \n$$r_i = \\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2+ \\frac{\\sigma\\Delta B}{\\Delta t}\\; .$$\nGiven historical data on the rates of return, the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ can be estimated by standard methods.\n\n\n## Tail Probabilities of Geometric Brownian Motions {#sec-tailprobs}\n\nFor each of the numeraires discussed in the previous section, we have\n$$\n\\d  \\log S = \\alpha\\d   t + \\sigma\\d   B\\;,\n$$ {#eq-tailprob1}\n\nfor some $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$, where $B$ is a Brownian motion under the probability measure associated with the numeraire.

Therefore $\\text{prob}(S_t<K) = 1-\\mathrm{N}(d)$.  This is the probability that a standard normal is greater than $d$, and by virtue of the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, it equals the probability that a standard normal is less than $-d$.

Show that $S(t)^2$ is a geometric Brownian motion if $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are constants and find $\\E[S(t)^2]$.\n::: \n\n::: {#exr-gbm2} \nLet\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\d S_1}{S_1} &= \\mu_1\\d t + \\sigma_1 \\d B_1\\\\\n\\frac{\\d S_2}{S_2} &= \\mu_1\\d t + \\sigma_2 \\d B_2\nwhere the $\\mu_i$ and $\\sigma_i$ are constants and $B_1$ and $B_2$ are Brownian motions with correlation $\\rho$.  \n1. Define $Y=S_1S_2$.  Show that $Y$ is a geometric Brownian motion and calculate its drift and volatility.\n2.
