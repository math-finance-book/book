The reason for studying the derivation of an option pricing formula is that it may better equip one to analyze new products.  Hopefully, this chapter will be of some assistance in that regard.  Of course, one cannot expect to derive a closed-form solution for the value of every product, and often numerical methods  will be necessary.  For a much more comprehensive presentation of exotic option pricing formulas, the book by Haug [@Haug] and the Excel software that accompanies it are highly recommended.  Zhang [@Zhang] is also a comprehensive reference for exotics. \n\nThe valuation of an American call option on an asset paying a discrete cash dividend (rather than a continuous dividend) is considered in @sec-s_discrete.  Under a particular assumption on the volatility, valuing this option is very similar to valuing a compound option.  Except for the assumption of a discrete dividend in @sec-s_discrete, we will make the Black-Scholes assumptions throughout this chapter: there is a constant risk-free rate $r$ and the underlying asset has a  constant volatility $\\sigma$ and a constant dividend yield $q$. \n\nThe order in which exotics are presented in this chapter is based on the simplicity of the analysis---the chapter begins with the easiest to analyze and works towards the more difficult.  This order is roughly the inverse of importance, the most important exotics in practice being barriers, baskets, spreads and Asians.  In the cases of Asian and basket options, we will explain why there are no simple closed-form formulas (sums of lognormally distributed random variables are not lognormal).  We will use these cases and discretely-sampled barriers and lookbacks as examples in the next chapter.  \n\n\n## Forward-Start Options\nA forward-start option \\index{forward-start option} is an option for which the strike price is set equal to the stock price at some later date.  In essence, it is issued at the later date, with the strike price set at the money.  For example, an executive may know that he is to be given an option grant at some later date with the strike price set equal to the stock price at that date.\n\n### Forward-Start Call Payoff\n\nA forward-start call is defined by its maturity date $T'$ and the date $T<T'$ at which the strike price is set.  The value of a forward-start call at maturity is\n$$\\max(0,S(T')-S(T))\\; .$$\nLet\n$$x= \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if $S(T')>S(T)$\\;,}\\\\\n                               0 & \\text{otherwise\\;.}\n        \\end{cases}\n$$\nThen, the value of the call at maturity can be written as \n$$xS(T')-xS(T)\\; .$$\n### Numeraires\n\n\n1. Use $V(t)=\\mathrm{e}^{qt}S(t)$ as numeraire to price the payoff $xS(T')$.  From the fundamental pricing @eq-formula, the value at date~0 is\n$$\\mathrm{e}^{-qT'}S(0)E^V[x] = \\mathrm{e}^{-qT'}S(0)\\times \\text{prob}^V\\!(S(T')>S(T))\\; .$$\n2. To price the payoff $xS(T)$, use the following portfolio as numeraire:^[We are going to use equation~@eq-probSnumeraire at date $T'$ to define the probabilities, because it will not be known until date $T'$ whether the event $S(T')>S(T)$ is true.  Thus, we need the price of a numeraire asset at date $T'$.  We would like this price to be a constant times $S(T)$, which is what we will obtain.  An equivalent numeraire is to make a smaller investment in the same portfolio: start with $\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)-qT}$ shares.  This results in a final value of $S(T)$ at date $T'$.  As will be seen, this is useful for deriving the put-call parity relation for forward-start options.]purchase $\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}$ shares of the stock at date 0 and reinvest dividends until date $T$.  This will result in the ownership of one share at date $T$, worth $S(T)$ dollars.  At date $T$, sell the share and invest the proceeds in the risk-free asset and hold this position until date $T'$.  At date $T'$, the portfolio will be worth $\\mathrm{e}^{r(T'-T)}S(T)$.  Let $Z(t)$ denote the value of this portfolio for each $0\\leq t\\leq T'$.  The fundamental pricing @eq-formula implies that the value of receiving $xS(T)$ at date $T'$ is\n\\begin{align*}\nZ(0)E^Z\\left[ \\frac{xS(T)}{Z(T')}\\right] &=\n\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}S(0)E^Z\\left[ \\frac{xS(T)}{\\mathrm{e}^{r(T'-T)}S(T)}\\right]\\\\&= \\mathrm{e}^{-qT-r(T'-T)}S(0)E^Z[x] \\\\&= \\mathrm{e}^{-qT-r(T'-T)}S(0) \\times\\text{prob}^Z(S(T')>S(T))\\;.\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n\n\n### Calculating Probabilities\n\n\n\n1. As in the case of a share digital, we know that\n$$ \n\\log S(t) = \\log S(0) + \\left(r-q +\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\sigma B^*(t)\n$$\nfor all $t>0$, where $B^*$ is a Brownian motion when $V$ is used as the numeraire.  Taking $t=T'$ and $t=T$ and subtracting yields\n$$\\log S(T')-\\log S(T) = \\left(r-q +\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)(T'-T) + \\sigma \\left[B^*(T')-B^*(T)\\right]\\; .$$\nHence, $S(T')>S(T)$ if and only if\n$$-\\frac{B^*(T')-B^*(T)}{\\sqrt{T'-T}} < \\frac{\\left(r-q +\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)(T'-T)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T'-T}}\\; .$$\nThe random variable on the left hand side is a standard normal, so\n$$ \n\\text{prob}^V\\!(S(T')>S(T)) = \\mathrm{N}(d_1)\\; ,\n$$\nwhere\n\n$$\nd_1 = \\frac{\\left(r-q +\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)(T'-T)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T'-T}} =\\frac{\\left(r-q +\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\sqrt{T'-T}}{\\sigma}\\;.\n$$ {#eq-forwardstart_d1}\n\n\n2. To calculate the probability $\\text{prob}^Z(S(T')>S(T))$, note that between $T$ and $T'$, the portfolio with price $Z$ earns the risk-free rate $r$.  The same argument presented in @sec-s_girsanov shows that between $T$ and $T'$ we have\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} S}{S} = (r-q)\\,\\mathrm{d} t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B^*\\; ,\n$$\nwhere now $B^*$ denotes a Brownian motion when $Z$ is used as the numeraire.   This implies as usual that\n$$\n \\mathrm{d}\\log S = \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d} t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B^*\\; ,\n $$\nwhich means that\n$$\n\\log S(T') - \\log S(T) = \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)(T'-T) + \\sigma(B^*(T')-B^*(T))\\; .\n$$\nHence, $S(T')>S(T)$ if and only if\n$$\n-\\frac{B^*(T')-B^*(T)}{\\sqrt{T'-T}} < \\frac{\\left(r-q -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)(T'-T)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T'-T}}\\; .\n$$\nAs before, the random variable on the left hand side is a standard normal, so\n$$\n\\text{prob}^Z(S(T')>S(T)) = \\mathrm{N}(d_2)\\; ,\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nd_2 = \\frac{\\left(r-q -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\sqrt{T'-T}}{\\sigma}=d_1-\\sigma\\sqrt{T'-T}\\;.\n$$ {#eq-forwardstart_d2}\n\n\n\n\n### Forward-Start Call Pricing Formula\nCombining these results, we have:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## \nThe value of a forward-start call at date 0 is\n$$\n\\mathrm{e}^{-qT'}S(0)\\mathrm{N}(d_1) - \\mathrm{e}^{-qT-r(T'-T)}S(0)\\mathrm{N}(d_2)\\;,\n$$ {#eq-fstrikecall}\n\nwhere $d_1$ and $d_2$ are defined in @eq-forwardstart_d1 - @eq-forwardstart_d2.\n:::\n\n\n### Put-Call Parity\\index{put-call parity}\n\n\\next Forward-strike calls and puts satisfy a somewhat unusual form of put-call parity.  The usual put-call parity is of the form:\n$$\n\\text{Call} \\;+\\; \\text{Cash} \\quad = \\quad \\text{Put} \\;+ \\;\\text{Underlying}\\; .\n$$\n\nThe amount of cash is the amount that will accumulate to the exercise price at maturity; i.e., it is $\\mathrm{e}^{-rT'}K$.  For forward-start calls and puts, the effective exercise price is $S(T)$, which is not known at date 0.  However, the portfolio used as numeraire to value the second part of the payoff will be worth $\\mathrm{e}^{r(T'-T)}S(T)$ at date $T'$, and by following the same strategy but starting with $\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)-qT}$ instead of $\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}$ shares, we will have $S(T)$ dollars at date $T'$.  The date--0 value of this portfolio should replace Cash in the above.  Thus:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## \nPut-call parity for forward-start calls and puts is\n$$\n\\text{Call Price} \\;+\\; \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)-qT}S(0) = \\text{Put Price} \\;+\\; \\mathrm{e}^{-qT'}S(0)\\;.\n$$ {#eq-fstrikeparity}\n\nThe new features in the option pricing formulas in this chapter are the use of the bivariate normal distribution function and sometimes the need to compute a critical (at-the-money) value of the underlying asset price.  We will compute the critical values by bisection, in the same way that we computed implied volatilities for the Black-Scholes formula in @sec-c_blackscholes.\n\nThe following is a fast approximation of the bivariate \\index{bivariate normal distribution function} cumulative normal distribution function, accurate to six decimal places, due to Drezner [@Drezner]).

These options are useful for hedging when there is some uncertainty about the need for hedging which may be resolved by the exercise date of the compound option.  As speculative trades, they have the benefit of higher leverage than ordinary options.  These options were first discussed by Geske [@Geske].\n\n### Call-on-a-Call Payoff\n\nLet the underlying call option have exercise price $K'$ and maturity $T'$.  Consider an option maturing at $T<T'$ to purchase the underlying call at price $K$.\n\nLet $C(t,S)$ denote the value at date $t$ of the underlying call when the stock price is $S$ (i.e., $C$ is the Black-Scholes formula).    It is of course rational to exercise the compound call at date $T$ if the value of the underlying call exceeds $K$; i.e., if $C(T,S(T))>K$.  Let $S^*$ denote the critical price such that $C(T,S^*)=K$.  To calculate $S^*$, we need to solve\n\n``` Black_Scholes_Call(S*,Kprime,r,sigma,q,Tprime-T) = K ```\n\nfor $S^*$.  We can do this by bisection or one of the other methods mentioned in @sec-s_impliedvolatility.\nIt is rational to exercise the compound option \nwhen $S(T) > S^*$.  \n\nWhen $S(T) > S^*$,  exercise of the compound option generates a cash flow of $-K$ at date $T$.  There is a cash flow (of $S(T')-K'$) at date $T'$ only if the compound call is exercised and the underlying call finishes in the money.  This is equivalent to:\n$$\nS(T) > S^* \\quad\\text{and}\\quad S(T')>K'\\;.\n$$ {#eq-compound1}\n\nLet\n\\begin{align*}\nx&= \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if $S(T)>S^*$\\;,}\\\\\n                               0 & \\text{otherwise\\;,}\n        \\end{cases}\\\\\ny&= \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if $S(T)>S^*$ and $S(T')>K'$\\;,}\\\\\n                               0 & \\text{otherwise\\;.}\n        \\end{cases} \n\\end{align*} \nThe cash flows of the compound option are $-xK$ at date $T$ and $yS(T')-yK'$ at date $T'$.  We can value the compound option at date 0 by valuing these separate cash flows.\n\nThe cash flow $-xK$ is the cash flow from being short $K$ digital options on the underlying asset with strike price $S^*$ and maturity $T$.  Therefore the value at date 0 of this cash flow is $-\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K\\mathrm{N}(d_2)$, where\n$$\nd_1 = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{S(0)}{S^*}\\right)+\\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}},  \\qquad d_2 = d_1-\\sigma\\sqrt{T}\\;.\n$$ {#eq-calloncalld1d2}\n\n\n\n### Numeraires\nThe payoffs $yS(T)$ and $yK'$ are similar to share digitals and digitals, respectively, except that the event $y=1$ is more complex than we have previously encountered.  However, we know from the analysis of share digitals and digitals that the values at date 0 of these payoffs are \n$$\n\\mathrm{e}^{-q T'}S(0)\\times\\text{prob}^V\\!(y=1) \\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\mathrm{e}^{-rT'}K'\\times\\text{prob}^R(y=1)\\; ,\n$$\nwhere $V(t)=\\mathrm{e}^{qt}S(t)$ and $R(t)=\\mathrm{e}^{rt}$.  \n\n### Calculating Probabilities\n\nWe will calculate the two probabilities in terms of the bivariate normal distribution function.  \n\n\n1. The event $y=1$ is equivalent to\n$$\n\\log S(0) + \\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T+\\sigma B^*(T) > \\log S^*\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\log S(0) + \\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T'+\\sigma B^*(T') > \\log K'\\; ,\n$$\nwhere $B^*$ is a Brownian motion when the underlying asset ($V$) is used as the numeraire. These conditions can be rearranged as\n\n$$-\\frac{B^*(T)}{\\sqrt{T}}<d_1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad - \\frac{B^*(T')}{\\sqrt{T'}}<d_1'\\;,\n$$ {#eq-new10}\n\nwhere $d_1$ is defined in @eq-calloncalld1d2, and\n$$\nd_1' = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{S(0)}{K'}\\right)+\\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T'}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T'}}\\;,\n \\qquad d_2'=d_1'-\\sigma\\sqrt{T'}\\;.\n$$ {#eq-callcallds}\n\n\n\nThe two standard normal variables on the left-hand sides in @eq-new10 have a covariance equal to\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{TT'}}\\mathrm{cov}(B(T),B(T')) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{TT'}}\\mathrm{cov}(B(T),B(T)) = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{T'}}\\; ,\n$$\n\nthe first equality following from the fact that $B(T)$ is independent of $B(T')-B(T)$ and the second from the fact that the covariance of a random variable with itself is its variance.\nHence, $\\text{prob}^V\\!(y=1)$ is the probability that $a\\leq d_1$ and $b\\leq d_1'$, where $a$ and $b$ are standard normal random variables with covariance (= correlation coefficient) of $\\sqrt{T/T'}$.  We will write this probability as $\\mathrm{M}\\!\\left(d_1,d_1',\\sqrt{T/T'}\\right)$.  A program to approximate the bivariate normal \\index{bivariate normal distribution function} distribution function $\\mathrm{M}$ is provided later.\n\n2. The calculation for $\\text{prob}^R(y=1)$ is similar.  The event $y=1$\nis equivalent to\n$$\n\\log S(0) + \\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T+\\sigma B^*(T) > \\log S^*\\;,\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\log S(0) + \\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T'+\\sigma B^*(T') > \\log K'\\; ,\n$$\nwhere $B^*$ now denotes a Brownian motion under the risk-neutral measure.

In the case of options on calls, put-call parity is specifically\n\\begin{multline*}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K + \\text{Value of call on call} \\\\= \\text{Value of underlying call} + \\text{Value of put on call}\\; ,\n\\end{multline*}\nwhere $K$ is the strike price of the compound options and $T$ is their maturity date.  Likewise, for options on puts, we have\n\\begin{multline*}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K + \\text{Value of call on put} \\\\= \\text{Value of underlying put} + \\text{Value of put on put}\\; .\n\\end{multline*}\nThus, the value of a put on a call can be derived from the value of a call on a call.  The value of a put on a put can be derived from the value of a call on a put, which we will now consider.\n\n### Call-on-a-Put Pricing Formula\n\nConsider a call option maturing at $T$ with strike $K$ with the underlying being a put option with strike $K'$ and maturity $T'>T$.  The underlying of the put is the asset with price $S$ and constant volatility $\\sigma$.  The call on the put will never be in the money at $T$ and hence is worthless if $K> \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)}K'$, because the maximum possible value of the put option at date $T$ is $\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)}K'$.  So assume $K< \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)}K'$.  \n\nLet $S^*$ again denote the critical value of the stock price such that the call is at the money at date $T$ when $S(T)=S^*$.  This means that $S^*$ solves\n\n```Black_Scholes_Put(S*,Kprime,r,sigma,q,Tprime-T) = K.```\n \nWe leave it as an exercise to confirm the following.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## \nThe value of a call on a put is\n\n$$\n\\begin{multline}\n-\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K\\mathrm{N}(-d_2) + \\mathrm{e}^{-rT'}K'\\mathrm{M}\\!\\left(-d_2,-d_2',\\sqrt{T/T'}\\right) \\\\- \\mathrm{e}^{-q T'}S(0)\\mathrm{M}\\!\\left(-d_1,-d_1',\\sqrt{T/T'}\\right) \\;,\n \\end{multline}\n$$ {#eq-callonaput}\n\n where $d_1$ and  $d_2$ are defined in @eq-calloncalld1d2 and $d_1'$ and $d_2'$ are defined in @eq-callcallds.\n:::\n\nWe will use bisection to find the critical price $S^*$.

The optimal exercise date will be immediately prior to the asset going ex-dividend.  Consider a call option maturing at $T'$ on an asset that will pay a known cash dividend $D$ at a known date $T<T'$.  We assume there is no continuous dividend payment, so $q=0$.  For simplicity, we assume that the date of the dividend payment is also the date that the asset goes ex-dividend; i.e., ownership of the asset at any date $t<T$ entitles the owner to receive the dividend at date $T$.  Under this assumption, it is reasonable also to assume that the stock price drops by $D$ when the dividend is paid.  \n\nThere is some ambiguity about how to define the asset price at the instant the dividend is paid---whether to include or exclude the dividend.  We will let $S(T)$ denote the price including the dividend and denote the price excluding the dividend by $Z(T)$, so $Z(T) = S(T)-D$.   In fact, it is convenient to let $Z(t)$ denote the price stripped of the dividend value at all dates $t \\leq T$, so we will define \n$$\nZ(t) = \\begin{cases}S(t)-\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}D & \\text{if $t \\leq T$\\;,}\\\\\nS(t) & \\text{if $t > T$\\;.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNote that $Z$ is the price of the following non-dividend-paying portfolio: buy one unit of the asset at date 0, borrow $\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}D$ at date 0 to help finance the purchase, and use the dividend $D$ at date $T$ to retire the debt.\n\nIf we assume as usual that the asset price $S$ has a constant volatility, then, using @eq-exponential1 for a geometric Brownian motion and letting $B^*$ denote a Brownian motion under the risk-neutral measure, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nS(T') &= [S(T)-D]\\exp\\left\\{(r-\\sigma^2/2)(T'-T)+\\sigma B^*(T')-\\sigma B^*(T)\\right\\}\\\\\n&= \\left[S(0)\\exp\\left\\{(r-\\sigma^2/2)T+\\sigma B^*(T)\\right\\}-D\\right]\\\\\n&\\qquad \\times \\exp\\left\\{(r-\\sigma^2/2)(T'-T)+\\sigma B^*(T')-\\sigma B^*(T)\\right\\}\\\\\n&=S(0)\\exp\\left\\{(r-\\sigma^2/2)T'+\\sigma B^*(T')\\right\\} \\\\\n&\\qquad - D\\exp\\left\\{(r-\\sigma^2/2)(T'-T)+\\sigma B^*(T')-\\sigma B^*(T)\\right\\}\\;.\n\\end{align*}\nThus, $S$ will be a sum of lognormal random variables.  A sum of lognormals is not itself lognormal, so $S$ will not be lognormal, and we are unable to calculate the option value in a simple way.\n\nWe will assume instead that $Z$ has a constant volatility $\\sigma$.  Thus, $Z$ is the price of a non-dividend-paying portfolio, it satisfies the Black-Scholes assumptions, and we have $S(T')=Z(T')$.  To value a European option, we would simply use $Z(0)=S(0)-\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}D$ as the initial asset price and $\\sigma$ as the volatility.\n\n### American Call Payoff\nIf the call is not exercised before the dividend is paid at date $T$, then its value at date $T$ will be\n\\begin{center}\n`Black_Scholes_Call(Z,K,r,sigma,0,Tprime-T)`\n\\end{center}\nwhere  `Z` $=Z(T)$.  Hence, exercise is optimal when\n\\begin{center}\n`Z` $+$ `D` $-$ `K` $>$ `Black_Scholes_Call(Z,K,r,sigma,0,Tprime-T)`\\;.\n\\end{center}\nA lower bound for the Black-Scholes call value on the right-hand side is $Z(T)-\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)}K$.  If $Z(T)+D-K$ is less than or equal to this lower bound, then exercise cannot be optimal.  Thus, if $D-K$ is less than or equal to $-\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)}K$, then exercise will never be optimal.  In this circumstance, the dividend is simply too small to offset the time value of money on the exercise price $K$,  and the value of the American call written on the asset with price $S$ is the same as the value of the European call written on the non-dividend-paying portfolio with price $Z$.  \n\nOn the other hand, if $D-K > -\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)}K$, then exercise will be optimal for sufficiently large $Z(T)$.  In this case, there is some\n$Z^*$ such that the owner of the call will be indifferent about exercise, and exercise will be optimal for \\vfil\\eject\nall $Z(T)>Z^*$.  This $Z^*$ is defined by\n\\begin{center}\n`Z*` $+$ `D` $-$ `K` $=$ `Black_Scholes_Call(Z*,K,r,sigma,0,Tprime-T)`\\;.\n\\end{center}\nAs in the previous section, we can compute $Z^*$ by bisection.  \n\nDefine\n\\begin{align*}\nx&= \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if $Z(T)>Z^*$\\;,}\\\\\n                               0 & \\text{otherwise\\;,}\n        \\end{cases}\\\\\ny&= \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if $Z(T)\\leq Z^*$ and $Z(T')>K$\\;,}\\\\\n                               0 & \\text{otherwise\\;.}\n        \\end{cases} \n\\end{align*} \nThen the American call option will pay $[Z(T)+D-K]x$ at date $T$ (due to early exercise) and $[Z(T')-K]y$ at date $T'$ (due to exercise at maturity), if $D-K > -\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)}K$.  \n\n### Numeraires\nAssume for now that $D-K > -\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)}K$.  The payoff $(D-K)x$ is the payoff of $D-K$ digital options maturing at $T$, and the payoff $Z(T)x$ is the payoff of one share digital on the portfolio with price $Z$.  Therefore, the value of receiving  $[Z(T)+D-K]x$ at date $T$ is\n$$\nZ(0)\\mathrm{N}(d_1) + \\mathrm{e}^{-rT}(D-K)\\mathrm{N}(d_2)\\; ,\n$$\nwhere\n\n\n$$\nd_1 = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{Z(0)}{Z^*}\\right)+\\left(r+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{S(0)-\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}D}{Z^*}\\right)+\\left(r+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}} \\;,\n$$ {#eq-americancalld1star}\n\n$$\nd_2=d_1-\\sigma\\sqrt{T}\\;.\n$$ {#eq-americancalld2star}\n\n\nAs in the previous section,^[The only difference is that here $Z$ is the price of a non-dividend-paying portfolio, so, in the notation of the previous section, we have $V(t)=Z(t)$.] the value of receiving $[Z(T)-K]y$ at date $T'$ is \n$$\nZ(0)\\times \\text{prob}^Z(y=1) - \\mathrm{e}^{-rT'}K\\times \\text{prob}^R(y=1)\\; .\n$$\n### Calculating Probabilities\nThe calculations are very similar to the calculations we did for a call option on a call.

Otherwise, we need to compute $Z^*$ and our bisection algorithm requires an upper bound for $Z^*$, which would be any value of $Z(T)$ such that exercise at $T$ is optimal.  It is not obvious what this should be, so we start with $K$ and keep doubling this until we obtain a value of $Z(T)$ at which exercise would be optimal.

We can find $S^*$ by solving\n\n```Black_Scholes_Call(S*,Kc,r,sigma,q,Tc-T) = Black_Scholes_Put(S*,Kp,r,sigma,q,Tp-T).```                           \n\n\n\\noindent For a simple chooser with $K_c=K_p=K$ and $T_c=T_p=T'$, we can find $S^*$ from the put-call parity relation at $T$, leading to $S^*=\\mathrm{e}^{(q-r)(T'-T)}K.$\n\nThe call will be chosen when $S(T)>S^*$ and it finishes in the money if $S(T_c)>K_c$ at date $T_c$, so the payoff of the chooser is $S(T_c)-K_c$ when \n$$S(T)>S^* \\quad \\text{and}\\quad S(T_c)>K_c\\;.\n$$\nThe payoff is $K_p-S(T_p)$ at date $T_p$ when \n$$\nS(T)<S^* \\quad \\text{and}\\quad S(T_p)<K_p\\;.\n$$\nLet \n\\begin{align*}\nx&= \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if $S(T)>S^* $ and $S(T_c)>K_c$\\;,}\\\\\n                               0 & \\text{otherwise\\;.}\n        \\end{cases}\\\\\ny&= \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if $S(T)<S^*$ and $S(T_p)<K_p$\\;,}\\\\\n                               0 & \\text{otherwise\\;.}\n        \\end{cases} \n\\end{align*}\nThen the payoff of the chooser is $xS(T_c)-xK_c$ at date $T_c$ and $yK_p-yS(T_p)$ at date $T_p$.\n\n### Numeraires\nAs in the analysis of compound options, the value of the chooser at date 0 must be \n\n$$\n\\begin{multline}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-q T_c}S(0)\\times\\text{prob}^V\\!(x=1) \\;- \\;\\mathrm{e}^{-rT_c}K_c\\times\\text{prob}^R(x=1)\n\\\\+\\; \\mathrm{e}^{-rT_p}K_p\\times\\text{prob}^R(y=1) \\;- \\;\\mathrm{e}^{-q T_p}S(0)\\times\\text{prob}^V\\!(y=1)\\;,\n\\end{multline}\n$$ {#eq-chooser1}\n\nwhere we use $V(t)=\\mathrm{e}^{qt}S(t)$ and $R(t)=\\mathrm{e}^{rt}$ as numeraires. \n\n### Chooser Pricing Formula\n@eq-chooser1 and calculations similar to those of the previous two sections lead us to:\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## \nThe value of a chooser option is \n\n$$\n\\begin{multline}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-q T_c}S(0)\\mathrm{M}\\!\\left(d_1,d_{1c},\\sqrt{T/T_c}\\right) - \\mathrm{e}^{-rT_c}K_c\\mathrm{M}\\!\\left(d_2,d_{2c},\\sqrt{T/T_c}\\right)\\\\ +\\mathrm{e}^{-rT_p}K_p\\mathrm{M}\\!\\left(-d_2,-d_{2p} , \\sqrt{T/T_p}\\right) \\\\- \\mathrm{e}^{-q T_p}S(0)\\mathrm{M}\\!\\left(-d_1 ,-d_{1p} ,\\sqrt{T/T_p}\\right)\\;,\n\\end{multline}\n$$ {#eq-chooser2}\n\nwhere\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{array}{ll}\nd_1 = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{S(0)}{S^*}\\right)+\\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\\;,\n& \\qquad d_2=d_1-\\sigma\\sqrt{T}\\;,\\\\\n&\\\\\nd_{1c} = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{S(0)}{K_c}\\right)+\\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T_c}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T_c}}\\;,\n& \\qquad d_{2c}=d_{1c}-\\sigma\\sqrt{T_c}\\;,\\\\\n&\\\\d_{1p} = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{S(0)}{K_p}\\right)+\\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T_p}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T_p}}\\;,\n& \\qquad d_{2p}=d_{1p}-\\sigma\\sqrt{T_p}\\;.\n\\end{array}\n\\end{equation*}\n:::\n\nTo implement the bisection to compute $S^*$, we can take zero as a lower bound and $K_c+K_p$ as an upper bound.^[We take the call value to be zero and the put value to be $\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T_p-T)}K_p$ at date $T$ when the stock price is zero.

If it does breach the lower barrier, then it is out.  Conversely, a down-and-in call pays off only if the stock price does hit the lower bound.  Up-and-out and up-and-in calls are defined similarly, and there are also put options of this sort.  The out versions are called knock-outs and the in versions are called knock-ins.  \n\nKnock-ins can be priced from knock-outs and vice-versa.  For example, the combination of a down-and-out call and a down-and-in call creates a standard European call, so the value of a down-and-in can be obtained by subtracting the value of a down-and-out from the value of a standard European call.  Likewise, up-and-in calls can be valued by subtracting the value of an up-and-out from the value of a standard European call.  Both knock-outs and knock-ins are of course less expensive than comparable standard options.\n\n\nWe will describe the pricing of a down-and-out call.  The pricing of up-and-out calls and knock-out puts is similar.  Often there are rebates associated with the knocking-out of a barrier option, but we will not include that feature here (see @sec-s_finitedifferencebarriers however).  \n\nA down-and-out call provides a hedge against an increase in an asset price, just as does a standard call, for someone who is short the asset.  The difference is that the down-and-out is knocked out when the asset price falls sufficiently.  Presumably this is acceptable to the buyer because the need to hedge against high prices diminishes when the price falls.  In fact, in this circumstance the buyer may want  to establish a new hedge at a lower strike.  However, absent re-hedging at a lower strike, the buyer of a knock-out call obviously faces the risk that the price may reverse course after falling to the knock-out boundary, leading to regret that the option was knocked out.  The rationale for accepting this risk is  that the knock-out is cheaper than a standard call.  Thus, compared to a standard call, a down-and-out call provides cheaper but incomplete insurance.\n\nThe combination of a knock-out call and a knock-in call (or knock-out puts) with the same barrier and different strikes creates an option with a strike that is reset when the barrier is hit.  This is a hedge that adjusts automatically to the market.  An example is given in Probs.~\\ref{e_standardknockout3} and~\\ref{e_standardknockout4}.\n\n### Down-and-Out Call Payoff\nLet $L$ denote the lower barrier for the down-and-out call and assume it has not yet been breached at the valuation date, which we are calling date 0.  Denote the minimum stock price realized during the remaining life of the contract by $z = \\min_{0\\leq t\\leq T} S(t)$.  In practice, this minimum is calculated at discrete dates (for example, based on daily closing prices), but we will assume here that the stock price is monitored continuously for the purpose of calculating the minimum. \n\nThe down-and-out call will pay $\\max(0,S(T)-K)$ if $z > L$ and 0 otherwise, \nat its maturity T.  \nLet\n$$\nx = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if $S(T)>K$ and $z > L$\\;,}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise\\;.} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThen the value of the down-and-out call at maturity is\n$$\nxS(T) - xK\\; .\n$$\n### Numeraires\nAs in other cases, the value at date 0 can be written as\n$$\n\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}S(0)\\times\\text{prob}^{V}(x=1) - \\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K\\times\\text{prob}^{R}(x=1)\\; ,\n$$\n\nwhere $V(t) = \\mathrm{e}^{qt}S(t)$ and $R(t)=\\mathrm{e}^{rt}$.\n\n### Calculating Probabilities\nTo calculate $\\text{prob}^{V}(x=1)$ and $\\text{prob}^{R}(x=1)$, we consider two cases.  \n\n\n1.

A floating-strike lookback put pays the difference between the maximum price over the life of the contract and the price at maturity.  Thus, the floating-strike lookback call allows one to buy the asset at its minimum price, and the floating-strike lookback put allows one to sell the asset at its maximum price.   Of course, one pays upfront for this opportunity to time the market.  These options were first discussed by Goldman, Sosin and Gatto [@GSG].\n\nA fixed-strike lookback put pays the difference between a fixed strike price and the minimum price during the lifetime of the contract.   Thus, a fixed-strike lookback put and a floating-strike lookback call are similar in one respect:  both enable one to buy the asset at its minimum price.  However, the put allows one to sell the asset at a fixed price whereas the call allows one to sell it at the terminal asset price.  A fixed-strike lookback call pays the difference between the maximum price and a fixed strike price and is similar to a floating-strike lookback put in the sense that both enable one to sell the asset at its maximum price.  Fixed-strike lookback options were first discussed by Conze and Viswanathan [@CV].\nWe will discuss the valuation of floating-strike lookback calls. As in the discussion of barrier options, we will assume that the price is continuously sampled for the purpose of computing the minimum.\n\n### Floating-Strike Lookback Call Payoff\n\nAs in the previous section, let $z$ denote the minimum stock price realized over the remaining lifetime of the contract.  This is not necessarily the minimum stock price realized during the entire lifetime of the contract.  Let $S_{\\min}$ denote the minimum stock price realized during the lifetime of the contract up to and including date 0, which is the date at which we are valuing the contract.  The minimum stock price during the entire lifetime of the contract will be the smaller of $z$ and $S_{\\text{min}}$.  The payoff of the floating strike lookback call is $S(T) - \\min\\left(z, S_{\\text{min}}\\right)$.\n\n\n\n\n### Calculations\nThe value at date 0 of the piece $S(T)$ is simply $\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}S(0)$.  Using the result in Appendix~\\ref{a_minimum} on the distribution of $z$, it can be shown (see, e.g., Musiela and Rutkowski [@MR] for the details) that the value at date 0 of receiving \n$$\n\\min(z, S_{\\text{min}})\n$$\nat date $T$ is\n\\begin{multline*}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}S_{\\text{min}}\\mathrm{N}(d_2) -\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2(r-q)}\\left(\\frac{S_{\\text{min}}}{S(0)}\\right)^{2(r-q)/\\sigma^2}\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}S(0)\\mathrm{N}(d_2') \\\\\n+\\left(1+ \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2(r-q)}\\right)\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}S(0)\\mathrm{N}(-d_1)\\;.\n\\end{multline*}\nwhere\n\n\n$$\nd_1 = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{S(0)}{S_{\\text{min}}}\\right)+\\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\\; , \\qquad d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T}\\;,\n$$ {#eq-fslc100a}\n\n$$\nd_1' = \\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{S_{\\text{min}}}{S(0)}\\right)+\\left(r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\\;, \\qquad d_2'=d_1' - \\sigma\\sqrt{T} \\;.\n$$ {#eq-fslc100c}\n\n\nUsing the fact that $[1-\\mathrm{N}(-d_1)]\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}S(0)=\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}S(0)\\mathrm{N}(d_1)$, this implies:\n\n### Floating-Strike Lookback Call Pricing Formula\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## \nThe value at date 0 of a continuously-sampled floating-strike lookback call, given that the minimum price during the lifetime of the contract through date 0 is $S_{\\text{min}}$ and the remaining time to maturity is $T$, is\n\n$$\n\\begin{multline}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}S(0)\\mathrm{N}(d_1)-\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}S_{\\text{min}}\\mathrm{N}(d_2) \\\\+\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2(r-q)}\\left(\\frac{S_{\\text{min}}}{S(0)}\\right)^{2(r-q)/\\sigma^2}\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}S(0)\\mathrm{N}(d_2') \\\\\n-\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2(r-q)}\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}S(0)\\mathrm{N}(-d_1)\\;,\n\\end{multline}\n$$ {#eq-fslc100}\n\nwhere $d_1$, $d_2$, and $d_2'$ are defined in @eq-fslc100a - @eq-fslc100c.\n:::\n\nThe following program calculates the price of a floating strike lookback option. \n\n::: {#floating_strike_lookback .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\ndef floating_strike_call(S, r, sigma, q, T, SMin):\n    d1 = (np.log(S / SMin) + (r - q + 0.5 * sigma ** 2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))\n    d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)\n    d2prime = (np.log(SMin / S) + (r - q - 0.5 * sigma ** 2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))\n    N1 = norm.cdf(d1)\n    N2 = norm.cdf(d2)\n    N2prime = norm.cdf(d2prime)\n    x = 2 * (r - q) / (sigma ** 2)\n    return np.exp(-q * T) * S * N1 - np.exp(-r * T) * SMin * N2 + (1 / x) * (SMin / S) ** x * np.exp(-r * T) * SMin * N2prime - (1 / x) * np.exp(-q * T) * S * (1 - N1)\n\n# Example usage\n\nS = 100\nr = 0.05\nsigma = 0.2\nq = 0.02\nT=1\n\n\nprint(\"Floating Strike Call:\", floating_strike_call(S, r, sigma, q, T, 90))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nFloating Strike Call: 16.27191861732918\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Basket and Spread Options {#sec-s_baskets}\n\nA spread option \\index{spread option} \\index{basket option} is a call or a put written on the difference of two asset prices.  For example, a spread call will pay at maturity $T$ the larger of zero and $S_1(T)-S_2(T)-K$, where the $S_i$ are the asset prices and $K$ is the strike price of the call.  Spread options can be used by producers to hedge the difference between an input price and an output price.  They are also useful for hedging basis risk.  For example, someone may want to hedge an asset by selling a futures contract on a closely related but not identical asset.  This exposes the hedger to basis risk: the difference in value between the asset and the underlying asset on the futures contract.  A spread call can hedge the basis risk: take $S_1$ to be the value of the asset underlying the futures contract and $S_2$ the value of the asset being hedged.\n\nA spread option is actually an exchange option.  Assuming constant dividend yields $q_1$ and $q_2$,  we can take the assets underlying the exchange option to be as follows\n\n \n1. At date 0, purchase $\\mathrm{e}^{-q_1T}$ units of the asset with price $S_1$ and reinvest dividends, leading to a value of $S_1(T)$ at date $T$, \n2. At date 0, purchase $\\mathrm{e}^{-q_2T}$ units of the asset with price $S_2$ and invest $\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K$ in the risk-free asset.  Reinvesting dividends and accumulating interest means that we will have $S_2(T)+K$ dollars at date $T$.\n\n\nHowever, we cannot apply Margrabe's formula to price spread options, because the second portfolio described above will have a stochastic volatility.  To see this, note that if the price $S_2(t)$ falls to a low level, then the portfolio will consist primarily of the risk-free asset, so the portfolio volatility will be near the volatility of the risk-free asset, which is zero.  On the other hand, if $S_2(t)$ becomes very high, then the portfolio will be weighted very heavily on the stock investment, and its volatility will approach the volatility of $S_2$.\n\nA basket option is an option written on a portfolio of assets.  For example, someone may want to hedge the change in the value of the dollar relative to a basket of currencies.  A basket option is an alternative to purchasing separate options on each currency.  Generally, the basket option would have a lower premium than the separate options, because an option on a portfolio is cheaper (and pays less at maturity) than a portfolio of options.  \n\nLetting $S_1$, \\ldots, $S_n$ denote the asset prices and $w_1$, \\ldots, $w_n$ the weights specified by the contract, a basket call would pay\n$$\\max\\left(0,\\;\\sum_{i=1}^n w_iS_i(T) - K\\right)$$\nat maturity $T$.  A spread option is actually a special case of a basket option, with $n=2$, $w_1=1$, and $w_2=-1$.  The difficulty in valuing basket options is the same as that encountered in valuing spread options.  The volatility of the basket price $\\sum_{i=1}^nw_iS_i(t)$ will vary over time, depending on the relative volatilities of the assets and the price changes in the assets.  For example, consider the case $n=2$ and write $S(t)$ for the basket price $w_1S_1(t)+w_2S_2(t)$.  Then\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} S}{S} &= \\frac{w_1\\,\\mathrm{d} S_1}{S} + \\frac{w_2\\,\\mathrm{d} S_2}{S}\\\\\n&=\\frac{w_1S_1}{S}\\times \\frac{\\mathrm{d} S_1}{S_1} + \\frac{w_2S_2}{S}\\times \\frac{\\mathrm{d} S_2}{S_2}\\;.\n\\end{align*}\nLet $x_i(t)=w_iS_i(t)/S(t)$.  This is the fraction of the portfolio value that the $i$--th asset contributes.  It will vary randomly over time as the prices change.  Letting $\\sigma_i$ denote the volatilities of the individual assets and $\\rho$ their correlation, the formula just given for $\\mathrm{d} S/S$ shows that the instantaneous volatility of the basket price at any date $t$ is\n$$\n\\sqrt{x_1^2(t)\\sigma_1^2 + 2x_1(t)x_2(t)\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + x_2^2(t)\\sigma_2^2}\\; .\n$$\n\nHence, the volatility will vary randomly over time as the $x_i$ change.  As in the case of spread options, there is no simple closed-form solution for the value of a basket option.\n\n## Asian Options {#sec-s_asians}\n\nAn Asian option \\index{Asian option} \\index{average-price option} \\index{average-strike option} is an option the value of which depends on the average underlying asset price during the lifetime of the option.  Average-price calls and puts are defined like standard calls and puts but with the final asset price replaced by the average price.  Average-strike calls and puts are defined like standard calls and puts but with the exercise price replaced by the average asset price.   A firm that must purchase an input at frequent intervals or will sell a product in a foreign currency at frequent intervals can use an average price option as an alternative to buying multiple options with different maturity dates.  The average-price option will generally be both less expensive and a better hedge than purchasing multiple options.\n\nIn practice, the average price is computed by averaging over the prices sampled at a finite number of discrete dates.  First, we consider the case of continuous sampling.  With continuous sampling, the average price at date $T$ for an option written at date 0 will be denoted by $A(T)$ and is defined as\n$$\nA(T) = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T S(t)\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\; .\n$$\nTo obtain a closed-form solution for the value of an option on the average price, we face essentially the same problem as for basket and spread options:  a sum of lognormally distributed variables is not itself lognormally distributed.  In this case, the integral, which is essentially a continuous sum of the prices at different dates, is not lognormally distributed.  \n\nAn alternative contract would replace the average price with the geometric average.  \\index{geometric average} \\index{geometric-average option} This is defined as the exponential of the average logarithm.  We will denote this by $A_\\text{g}(T)$.  The average logarithm is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\log S(t)\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\; ,\n$$\nand the geometric average is\n$$\nA_\\text{g}(T) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\log S(t)\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\right)\\; .\n$$\nThe concavity of the logarithm function guarantees that\n$$\n\\log \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T S(t) > \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\log S(t)\\,\\mathrm{d} t \\; .\n$$\nTherefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nA(T) &= \\exp\\left(\\log \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T S(t)\\right)\\\\\n&> \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\log S(t)\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\right) \\\\\n&= A_\\text{g}(T)\\; .\n\\end{align*}\nConsequently, approximating the value of an average-price or average-strike option by substituting $A_\\text{g}(T)$ for $A(T)$ will produce a biased estimate of the value.  Nevertheless, the geometric average$A_\\text{g}(T)$ and the arithmetic average $A(T)$ will be highly correlated, so $A_\\text{g}(T)$ forms a very useful \\text{control variate} for Monte-Carlo valuation of average-price and average-strike options, as will be discussed later.  To implement the idea, we need a valuation formula for options written on $A_\\text{g}(T)$.  We will derive this for an average-price call, in which $A_\\text{g}(T)$ substitutes for $A(T)$.\n\nSpecifically, consider a contract that pays\n$$\n\\max(0,A_\\text{g}(T)-K)\n$$\nat its maturity $T$.\nThis is a geometric-average-price call,, and we will analyze it in the same way that we analyzed quanto options in @sec-c_foreignexchange.  Let $V(t)$ denote the value at date $t$ of receiving $A_\\text{g}(T)$ at date $T$.  This can be calculated, and the result will be given below.  $V(t)$ is the value of a non-dividend-paying portfolio, and, by definition, $V(T)=A_\\text{g}(T)$, so the geometric-average-price call is equivalent to a standard call with $V$ being the price of the underlying.  We will show that $V$ has a time-varying but non-random volatility.  Therefore, we can apply the Black-Scholes formula, inputting the average volatility as described in @sec-s_timevaryingvolatility, to value the geometric-average-price call.  We could attempt the same route to price average-price options, but we would find that the volatility of the corresponding value $V$ would vary randomly, just as we found the basket portfolio to have a random volatility in the previous section.\n\nThe value $V(t)$ can be calculated as\n$$\nV(t)= \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}E^R_t\\big[A_\\text{g}(T)\\big]\\; .\n$$\nDefine\n$$\nA_g(t) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\int_0^t \\log S(u)\\,du\\right)\\;.\n$$\n\nWe will verify at the end of this section that\n$$\nV(t) = \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}A_g(t)^{\\frac{t}{T}}S(t)^{\\frac{T-t}{T}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{(r-q-\\sigma^2/2)(T-t)^2}{2T} + \\frac{\\sigma^2(T-t)^3}{6T^2}\\right)\\;.\n$$ {#eq-geometricaveragev1}\n\nTwo points are noteworthy.

The call option will pay $\\max(0,V(T)-K)$ at date $T$.  Let $k$ denote the integer such that $t_{N-k-1} \\leq t < t_{N-k}$.  This means that we have already observed the prices $S(t_1), \\ldots, S(t_{N-k-1})$ and we have yet to observe the $k+1$ prices $S(t_{N-k}), \\ldots ,S(t_N)$.  Define $\\varepsilon = (t_{N\\!-k}-t)/\\Delta t$, which is fraction of the interval $\\Delta t$ that must pass before we reach the next sampling date $t_{N\\!-k}$.  We will show at the end of this section that \n\n$$\n\\begin{multline}\nV(t) = \\mathrm{e}^{-r(T-t)}S(t)^{\\frac{k+1}{N}}\\prod_{i=1}^{N-k-1}S(t_i)^{\\frac{1}{N}}\\\\\n\\times\\,\\exp\\left(\\left[ \\frac{(k+1)\\varepsilon\\nu}{N}\\!+\\! \\frac{k(k+1)\\nu}{2N}\\! +\\! \\frac{(k+1)^2\\sigma^2\\varepsilon}{2N^2}\\!+\\!\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)\\sigma^2}{12N^2} \\right]\\Delta t\\right)\\;,\n\\end{multline}\n$$ {#eq-geometricaveragev2}\n\nwhere $\\nu = r-q-\\sigma^2/2$\n\nAgain, two points are noteworthy.

To establish this, and to calculate the mean and variance of $A_g(T)$, the key is to change the order of integration in the integral in the second line below to obtain the third line:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_t^T \\log S(u)\\,du &= \\int_t^T \\left\\{\\log S(t) + \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)(u-t) + \\sigma [B(u)-B(t)]\\right\\}\\,du\\\\\n&= (T-t)\\log S(t) + \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\frac{(T-t)^2}{2} + \\sigma\\int_t^T \\int_t^u \\mathrm{d} B(s)\\,du\\\\\n&= (T-t)\\log S(t) + \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\frac{(T-t)^2}{2} + \\sigma\\int_t^T \\int_s^T du\\,\\mathrm{d} B(s)\\\\\n&= (T-t)\\log S(t) + \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\frac{(T-t)^2}{2} + \\sigma\\int_t^T (T-s)\\,\\mathrm{d} B(s)\n\\end{align*}\nand then to note that $\\int_t^T (T-s)\\,\\mathrm{d} B(s)$ is normally distributed with mean zero and variance equal to \n$$\n\\int_t^T (T-s)^2\\,ds =\\frac{(T-t)^3}{3}\\;.\n$$\nTherefore $E^R_t\\left[A_g(T)\\right]$ is the expectation of the exponential of a normally distributed random variable.

Examples of path-dependent options are lookbacks, barrier options, and Asians.\nTo value a path-dependent option by Monte Carlo, we need to simulate an approximate path of the stock price.  We do this by considering time periods of length $\\Delta t = T/N$ for some integer $N$.  Under the risk-neutral measure, the logarithm of the stock price changes over such a time period by\n$$\n\\Delta \\log S = \\nu\\,\\Delta t + \\sigma\\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,z\\;,\n$$ {#eq-pathdependent}\n\nwhere $\\nu = r-q-\\sigma^2/2$ and $z$ is a standard normal.  Given that there are $N$ time periods of length $\\Delta t$, we need to generate $N$ standard normals to generate a stock price path.  If we generate $M$ paths to obtain a sample of $M$ option values, then we will need to generate $MN$ standard normals.  \n\n\nConsider for example a floating-strike lookback call. \\index{lookback option} The formula for this option given in @sec-s_lookbacks assumes the minimum stock price is computed over the entire path of the stock price, i.e., with continuous sampling of the stock price.  In practice, the minimum will be computed by recording the price at a discrete number of dates.  We can value the discretely sampled lookback using Monte-Carlo by choosing $\\Delta t$ to be the interval of time (e.g., a day or week) at which the price is recorded.  For example, if the contract calls for weekly observation, we will attain maximum precision by setting $N$ to be the number of weeks before the option matures.\n\nFor most path dependent options, a possible starting point is to generate an array of $n$ paths but since we want the entire path we choose the number of time steps that is appropriate for our application.

As noted in @sec-s_baskets, there are no simple formulas for these options. In each simulation, we will generate a terminal price for each of the underlying assets and compute the value of the option at its maturity. \nDiscounting the average terminal value gives the estimate of the option value as usual.  \n\nThe difference between binomial and Monte Carlo methods for options written on multiple assets can be understood as follows.  Both methods attempt to estimate the discounted expected value of the option (under the risk-neutral measure).  In an $N$--period model, the binomial model produces $N+1$ values for the terminal price of each underlying asset.  Letting $k$ denote the number of underlying assets, this produces $(N+1)^k$ combinations of asset prices.  Of course, each combination has an associated probability.  In contrast, the Monte Carlo method produces $M$ combinations of terminal prices, where $M$ is the number of simulations.  Each combination is given the same weight ($1/M$) when estimating the expected value.  \n\nWith a single underlying asset, the binomial model is more efficient, as discussed in @sec-s_introbinomial, because the specifically chosen terminal prices in the binomial model sample the set of possible terminal prices more efficiently than randomly generated terminal prices.  However, this advantage disappears, and the ranking of the methods can be reversed, when there are several underlying assets.  The reason is that many of the $(N+1)^k$ combinations of prices in the binomial model will have very low probabilities.  For example, with two assets that are positively correlated, it is very unlikely that one asset will be at its highest value in the binomial model and the other asset simultaneously at its lowest.  It is computationally wasteful to evaluate the option for such a combination, because the probability-weighted value will be very small and hence contribute little to the estimate of the expected value.  On the other hand, each set of terminal prices generated by the Monte Carlo method will be generated from a distribution having the assumed correlation.  Thus, only relatively likely combinations will typically be generated, and time is not wasted on evaluating unlikely combinations.  However, it should not be concluded that Monte Carlo valuation of a derivative on multiple assets will be quick and easy---even though the computation time required for more underlying assets does not increase as much with Monte Carlo as for binomial models, it can nevertheless be substantial.\n\nTo implement Monte Carlo valuation of options on multiple assets, we must first explain how to simulate correlated asset prices.\nAs observed in @sec-s_stochasticvolatility, we can simulate the changes in two Brownian motions $B_1$ and $B_2$ that have correlation $\\rho$ by generating two independent standard normals $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ and defining\n$$\n\\Delta B_1 = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,Z_1\\;, \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\Delta B_2 = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\,Z\\; ,\n$$\nwhere $Z$ is defined as \n$$\nZ = \\rho Z_1 + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}\\,Z_2\\;.\n$$\nThe random variable $Z$ is also a standard normal, and the correlation between $Z_1$ and $Z$ is $\\rho$.  \n\n::: {#c683510b .cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Simulate 2 Geometric Brownian Motions\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# number of paths\nn = 1000\n#number of divisions\nm = 1000\n# Interest rate (We set the drift equal to the interest rate for the risk neutral measure)\nr = 0.1\n# Dividend yield\nq1=0.0\nq2=0\n# Volatility\nsig1 = 0.2\nsig2=.3\n# correlation\nrho=0.5\n# Initial Stock Price\nS0 = 42\nV0 = 50\n# Maturity\nT = 0.5\n\n# Delta t\ndt = T/m\n# Drift\ndrift1 = (r-q1-0.5*sig1**2)\ndrift2 = (r-q2-0.5*sig2**2)\n# Volatility\nvol = np.sqrt(dt)\n\nt = np.array(range(0,m + 1,1)) * dt\n\n# seed for random generator\nseed= 2024\n# define a random generator\nnp.random.seed(seed)\ninc = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\ninc[1:] = np.transpose(np.random.normal(loc = 0, scale = vol,size = (n,m)))\ninc1 = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\ninc1[1:] = np.transpose(np.random.normal(loc = 0, scale = vol,size = (n,m)))\nincr = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\nincr = rho*inc + np.sqrt(1-rho**2)*inc1\n```\n:::\n\n\nThus, we can simulate the changes in the logarithms of two correlated asset prices as\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta \\log S_1 &= \\nu_1\\Delta t + \\sigma_1\\sqrt{\\Delta t}Z_1 \\; ,\\\\\n\\Delta \\log S_2 &= \\nu_2\\Delta t + \\sigma_2\\rho\\sqrt{\\Delta t}Z_1 + \\sigma_2\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}\\sqrt{\\Delta t}Z_2\\;,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\nu_i = r-q_1-\\sigma_i^2/2$ and the $Z_i$ are independent standard normals. \n\n::: {#c9cd64f8 .cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nSt1 = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\nSt2 = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\nSt1 = S0 * np.exp(sig1*np.cumsum(inc,axis=0) + (drift1 * t[0:m + 1])[:,None])\nSt2 = V0 * np.exp(sig2*np.cumsum(incr,axis=0) + (drift2 * t[0:m + 1])[:,None])\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can also construct antithetic variables.\n\n::: {#c38e4a58 .cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nSt1a = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\nSt2a = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\nSt1a = S0 * np.exp(-sig1*np.cumsum(inc,axis=0) + (drift1 * t[0:m + 1])[:,None])\nSt2a = V0 * np.exp(-sig2*np.cumsum(incr,axis=0) + (drift2 * t[0:m + 1])[:,None])\n```\n:::\n\n\nGiven this sample, we can estimate the value of a best of 2 option with payoff $\\max(S_{1T},S_{2T})$.\n\n::: {#23933868 .cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\npayoff = np.maximum(St1[m,:],St2[m,:])\npayoffa = np.maximum(St1a[m,:],St2a[m,:])\nvalue= np.exp(-r*T)*np.mean(payoff)\nvaluea= np.exp(-r*T)*np.mean(payoffa)\n\nprint('The first estmate is =',value)\nprint('The second estimate is =',valuea)\nprint('The avergae of the estimates is=',(value+valuea)/2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe first estmate is = 50.11374784508302\nThe second estimate is = 51.46596027225067\nThe avergae of the estimates is= 50.78985405866685\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo generalize this idea to more than two assets, we introduce some additional notation.

However a standard basket option is not path dependent, so we only need to simulate the asset prices at the option maturity date $T$, as in @sec-s_mc_europeans.  The value of a basket call option at its maturity $T$ is \n$$\n\\max\\left(0,\\;\\sum_{i=1}^L w_iS_i(T)-K\\right)\\; ,\n$$\nwhere $L$ is the number of assets in the basket (portfolio) and $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$--th asset in the basket.\nThe logarithm of the $i$--th asset price at maturity is simulated as\n$$\n\\log S_i(T) = \\log S_i(0) +\\nu_iT + \\sqrt{T} \\sum_{j=1}^L a_{ij}Z_j\\; ,\n$$\nwhere the $Z_j$ are independent standard normals.  Given the simulated values of the $\\log S_i(T)$, the value at maturity of the basket option is readily computed.  The estimate of the date--0 value is then computed as the discounted average of the simulated values at maturity.  \n\nFor our two asset example we compute the value of a call opttion on an equally weighted porfotlio.\n\n::: {#9b041091 .cell execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nw=0.5\nK=45\nbasketpo=np.maximum(w*St1[m,:]+(1-w)*St2[m,:]-K,0)\nbasketpoa=np.maximum(w*St1a[m,:]+(1-w)*St2a[m,:]-K,0)\nestimate=np.exp(-r*T)*np.mean(basketpo)\nestimatea=np.exp(-r*T)*np.mean(basketpoa)\nprint('The first estimate is =',estimate)\nprint('The second estimate is =',estimatea)\nprint('The average of the estimates=',(estimate+estimatea)/2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe first estimate is = 4.4030641748675095\nThe second estimate is = 4.945665333101932\nThe average of the estimates= 4.674364753984721\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBelow is a three asset basket option whihc uses the numpy cholesky decomposition.

We will illustrate for an option on two assets.  This is the most important case, and the extension to more than two assets is straightforward.\n\nConsider two stocks with constant dividend yields $q_i$ and constant volatilities $\\sigma_i$.  Suppose the two Brownian motions driving the two stocks have a constant correlation coefficient $\\rho$.  We will denote the price of stock $i$ ($i=1,2$) in the up state in each period by $u_iS_i$ and the price in the down state by $d_iS_i$, where $S_i$ is the price at the beginning of the period, and $u_i$ and $d_i$ are parameters to be specified.  In each period, there are four possible combinations of returns on the two stocks:  up for both stocks, up for stock 1 and down for stock~2, down for stock 1 and up for stock 2, and down for both stocks.  Denote the probabilities of these four combinations by $p_{uu}$, $p_{ud}$, $p_{du}$, and $p_{dd}$ respectively.  Thus, there are eight parameters in the binomial model: the number $N$ of periods (which defines the length of each period as $\\Delta t=T/N$ where $T$ is the option maturity), the up and down parameters $u_i$ and $d_i$ for each stock, and three probabilities (the fourth probability being determined by the condition that the probabilities sum to one).\n\nGiven the period length $\\Delta t$, we want to choose the up and down parameters and the probabilities to match (or approximately match in an appropriate sense) the means, variances and covariances of the returns $\\Delta S_i/S_i$ or the continuously-compounded returns $\\Delta \\log S_i$.  There are two means, two variances and one covariance, so there are five restrictions to be satisfied and seven parameters.  As in @sec-c_introcomputation, it is convenient to take $d_i = 1/u_i$, leaving five restrictions and five free parameters.\n\nAs discussed in @sec-s_binomialparameters, there are multiple ways to define the binomial model so that it converges to the continuous-time model as the number of periods is increased.  As an example, we will describe here the suggestion of Trigeorgis [@Trigeorgis], \\index{Trigeorgis model}which matches the means, variances and covariance of the continuously-compounded returns.\nLetting $p_i$ denote the probability of the up state for stock $i$,  matching the means and variances implies, as in @sec-s_binomialparameters,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log u_i&=\\sqrt{\\sigma_i^2\\Delta t + \\nu_i^2(\\Delta t)^2}\\; ,\\\\\np_i &= \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\nu_i\\Delta t}{2\\log u_i}\\;.\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\nu_i=r-q_i-\\sigma_i^2/2$.\nIn terms of the notation $p_{uu}$, $p_{ud}$, $p_{du}$, and $p_{dd}$, the probability of the up state for stock 1 is $p_1=p_{uu}+p_{ud}$ and the probability of the up state for stock 2 is $p_2=p_{uu}+p_{du}$.  Therefore,\n\n\n$$\np_{uu}+p_{ud} = \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\nu_1\\Delta t}{2\\log u_1}\\;,\n$$ {#eq-prob1}\n\n$$\np_{uu}+p_{du} = \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\nu_2\\Delta t}{2\\log u_2}\\;.\n$$ {#eq-prob2}\n\n\n\nIn the continuous time model, over a discrete time period $\\Delta t$, the covariance of $\\Delta \\log S_1$ and $\\Delta \\log S_2$ is $\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\Delta t$.  In the binomial model, with $d_i=1/u_i$, we have\n$$\nE \\big[\\Delta \\log S_1 \\times \\Delta \\log S_2\\big] = (p_{uu}-p_{ud}-p_{du}+p_{dd})\\log u_1\\log u_2\\;.\n$$  Given that $E[\\Delta\\log S_i] =\\nu_i\\Delta t$, this implies a covariance of\n$$\n(p_{uu}-p_{ud}-p_{du}+p_{dd})\\log u_1\\log u_2 - \\nu_1\\nu_2(\\Delta t)^2\\;.\n$$\nMatching the covariance in the binomial model to the covariance in the continuous-time model therefore implies\n$$\np_{uu}-p_{ud}-p_{du}+p_{dd} =\\frac{\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\Delta t + \\nu_1\\nu_2(\\Delta t)^2}{\\log u_1\\log u_2}\\;.\n$$ {#eq-prob3}\n\n\n\nWe can solve the system @eq-prob1 - @eq-prob3, together with the condition that the probabilities sum to one, to obtain the probabilities $p_{uu}$, $p_{ud}$, $p_{du}$, and $p_{dd}$.  This solution and a  Python function for valuing an American spread call option are given later.  This function operates much like the binomial valuation of American options described in @sec-c_introcomputation.  The primary difference is that the value of the option at maturity depends on both stock prices, so we have to consider each possible combination of stock prices.  In an $N$--period model, there are $N+1$ nodes at the final date for each of the two stocks, and hence $(N+1)^2$ possible combinations of nodes.  In fact, at each date $n$ ($n=0,\\ldots,N$) there are $(n+1)^2$ combinations of nodes to be considered.  \nThe computation time required for a spread call option is therefore roughly the square of the time required for a standard call.  \n\nLikewise, in an $N$--period model for a basket option written on three assets, there are $(n+1)^3$ combinations of nodes to be considered at date $n$; if there are five assets, there are $(n+1)^5$ combinations, etc.  Thus, the computation time required increases exponentially with the number of assets.  This can be a serious problem.  For example, with five assets and $N=99$, we would have $100^5$ (10 billion) combinations.  As this suggests, problems with multiple assets quickly become intractable in a binomial framework.  This is called the curse of dimensionality. \\index{curse of dimensionality}\n\n\n## Variance Swaps\n\nVariance swaps are a type of futures contracts that allows investors to trade future realized volatility against current option implied variance. Unlike traditional futures, which provide a payoff based on the difference between the underlying asset's price and the futures price, variance swaps provide a payoff based on the difference between the realized variance of the underlying asset and the predetermined variance level (termed ``Strike'' in practice), which is the futures price in variance unit. \n\nVariance swaps have gained popularity due to their ability to provide pure exposure to the volatility of an underlying asset, independent of its price movements. Unlike traditional options, variance swaps allow investors to speculate on or hedge against changes in volatility without the need for constant delta hedging. This makes them an effective tool for managing volatility risk and for executing volatility arbitrage strategies, as they simplify the trading of variance and offer a more straightforward payoff structure based on realized versus implied volatility.\n\n\n\n### Payoff of a Variance Swap\n\nA variance swap is a future contract on future realized variance. Its main components include:\n\n- **Notional Amount**: Specifies the amount of money to be paid for each unit of variance difference.\n- **Strike**: The predetermined level of variance agreed upon at the inception of the swap.\n- **Realized Variance**: Calculated from the returns of the underlying asset over the life of the swap.\n\nThe payoff of a variance swap is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{Payoff} = \\text{Notional} \\times (\\text{Realized Variance} - \\text{Strike})\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- **Realized Variance** is typically calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Realized Variance} = \\frac{252}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\log\\left(\\frac{S_i}{S_{i-1}}\\right) \\right)^2\n$$\n\nHere, $S_i$ represents the price of the underlying asset at time $i$, and $N$ is the number of trading days over the contract period.\n\n\n**Example**: Suppose an investor enters into a variance swap with a notional amount of \\$100,000 and a strike of 0.04 (implying a volatility strike of 20%). If the realized variance over the swap's life is 0.06 (implying a realized volatility of 24.5%), the payoff would be:\n\n$$\n\\text{Payoff} = 100,000 \\times (0.06 - 0.04) = 100,000 \\times 0.02 = 2,000\n$$\n\nThis means the investor would receive \\$2,000 at the end of the swap period.\n\nAs all futures constracts, variance swaps are marked to market on each trading day. \n\nVariance swaps can be used to hedge against volatility risk. For example, a portfolio manager concerned about increasing market volatility can buy variance swaps to protect the portfolio's value. \n\nTraders can also use variance swaps to speculate or arbitrage on future volatility. For example, If a trader believes that future volatility will be higher than the current implied volatility, they can enter a variance swap to profit from this view.\n\n### Pricing of a Variance Swap for Stocks with Geometric Brownian Motion Prices\n\nSimilor the pricing of a futures, we need find the fair swap strike such that the initial value of the swap is zero. For simplicity, consider a stock whose price $S_t$ follows a geometric Brownian motion process:\n\n$$ \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \\mu \\, dt + \\sigma \\, dZ_t\n $$\n\nApplying Ito's Lemma to $\\log(S_t)$:\n\n$$ d(\\log S_t) = \\left( \\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right) \\, dt + \\sigma \\, dZ_t \n$$\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n$$ \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} - d(\\log S_t) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\, dt\n $$\n\n\nIntegrating over the life of the swap \\( [0, T] \\):\n\n$$ \\text{Total Variance} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\sigma^2 \\, dt = \\frac{2}{T} \\left( \\int_0^T \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} - \\log \\left( \\frac{S_T}{S_0} \\right) \\right),  \n$$\nwhich implies that the total variance can be replicated by continuously rebalancing the stock position with weight $1/S_t$ and shorting one unit of the security which pays the $\\log$ return of the stock. However, this $\\log$ return secutiry is not traded in the market. Fortunately, we can synthesize this security with a forward and options, because \n\n$$\n-ln (\\frac{S_T}{S^*})=-\\frac{S-S^*}{S^*}+\\int_0^{S^*}\\frac{(K-S)^+}{K^2}dK+\\int_{S^*}^\\infty\\frac{(S-K)^+}{K^2}dK,\n$$\nwhere $S^*$ is an arbitrary cut-off strike for calls and puts, the first term on the right hand side represents a short position in the forward contract on the stock, the second term represents a continuum of put options with strike prices from 0 to $S^*$, and  the third term represents a continuum of call options with strike prices above $S^*$. Taking expectation under the risk neutral measure, we have that the fair swap strike $K_{\\text{var}}$ is equal to:\n\n$$ K_{\\text{var}} = \\frac{2}{T} \\left( rT - \\left( \\frac{S_0}{S^*} e^{rT} - 1 \\right) - \\log \\left( \\frac{S^*}{S_0} \\right) + e^{rT} \\int_0^{S^*} \\frac{1}{K^2} P(K) \\, dK + e^{rT} \\int_{S^*}^\\infty \\frac{1}{K^2} C(K) \\, dK \\right) \n$$\n\n\nChoosing $S^*$ to be the current forward price $F_0=S_0 e^{rT}$:\n\n$$ K_{\\text{var}} = \\frac{2 e^{rT}}{T} \\left( \\int_0^{F_0} \\frac{P(K)}{K^2} \\, dK + \\int_{F_0}^\\infty \\frac{C(K)}{K^2} \\, dK \\right) \n$$\n\nThis formula allows us to compute the fair strike price of a variance swap using the prices of European call and put options.

Create a Python program to confirm this.  Allow the user to input $S$, $r$, $\\sigma$, $q$, and $T'$.  Compute and plot the value of the option for $T=0.1T'$, $T=0.2T'$, \\ldots, $T=0.9T'$.\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Create a Python program to demonstrate the additional leverage of a call-on-a-call relative to a standard call.  Allow the user to input $S$, $r$, $\\sigma$, $q$, and $T'$.  Use the `Black-Scholes_Call` function to compute and output the value $C$ of a European call with strike $K'=S$ (i.e., the call is at the money) and maturity $T'$.  Use the `Call_on_Call` function to compute and output the value of a call option on the call with strike $K=C$ (i.e., the call-on-a-call is at the money) and maturity $T=0.5T'$.  Compute the percentage returns the standard European call and the call-on-a-call would experience if the stock price $S$ instantaneously increased by 10\\%.\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Create a Python program to illustrate the early exercise premium for an American call on a stock paying a discrete dividend.  Allow the user to input $S$, $r$, $\\sigma$, and $T'$.  Take the date of the dividend payment to be $T=0.5T'$ and take the strike price to be $K=S$.  As discussed in @sec-s_discrete, the value of a European call is given by the Black-Scholes formula with $S-\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}D$ being the initial asset price and $q=0$ being the constant dividend yield.  Use the function `American_Call_Dividend` to compute the value of an American call for dividends $D=.1S$, \\ldots $D=.9S$.  Subtract the value of the European call with the same dividend to obtain the early exercise premium.  Plot the early exercise premium against the dividend $D$.\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Create a Python function to value a simple chooser (a chooser option in which $K_c=K_p$ and $T_c=T_p$) using put-call parity to compute $S^*$ as mentioned in @sec-s_choosers.  Verify that the function gives the same result as the function `Chooser`.\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Create a Python code to compare the cost of a simple chooser to that of a straddle (straddle = call + put with same strike and maturity).  Allow the user to input $S$, $r$, $\\sigma$, $q$, and $T'$.  Take the time to maturity of the underlying call and put to be $T'$ for both the chooser and the straddle.  Take the strike prices to be $K=S$.  Take the time the choice must be made for the chooser to be $T=0.5T'$.  Compute the cost of the chooser and the cost of the straddle.\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n A stock has fallen in price and you are attempting to persuade a client that it is now a good buy.  The client believes it may fall further before bouncing back and hence is inclined to postpone a decision.  To convince the client to buy now, you offer to deliver the stock to him at the end of two months at which time he will pay you the lowest price it trades during the two months plus a fee for your costs.  The stock is not expected to pay a dividend during the next two months.  Assuming the stock actually satisfies the Black-Scholes assumptions, find a formula for the minimum fee that you would require.  (Hint:  It is almost in @sec-s_lookbacks.)  Create a Python program allowing the user to input $S$, $r$, and $\\sigma$  and computing the minimum fee.\n:::\n::: {#exr-e_standardknockout}\n  Suppose you must purchase 100 units of an asset at the end of a year.  Create a Python program simulating the asset price and comparing the quality of the following hedges (assuming 100 contracts of each):\n\n\n\n1. a standard European call,\n2. a down-and-out call in which the knock-out barrier is 10\\% below the current price of the asset.\n\n\nTake both options to be at the money at the beginning of the year.  Allow the user to input $S$, $r$, $\\sigma$ and $q$.   Generate 500 simulated end-of-year costs (net of the option values at maturity) for each hedging strategy and create histogram charts to visually compare the hedges.  Note: to create histograms, you will need the Data Analysis add-in, which may be need to be loaded (click Tools/Add Ins).\n:::\n::: {#exr-e_standardknockout2}\n\nCompute the prices of the options in the previous exercise.  Modify the simulations to compare the end-of-year costs including the costs of the options, adding interest on the option prices to put everything on an end-of-year basis.\n:::\n::: {#exr-e_standardknockout3}\n \nModify @exr-e_standardknockout by including a third hedge: a combination of a down-and-out call as in part (b) of @exr-e_standardknockout and a down-and-in call with knockout barrier and strike 10\\% below the current price of the asset.  Note that this combination forms a call option with strike that is reset when the underlying asset price hits a barrier.\n:::\n::: {#exr-e_standardknockout4}\n\nModify @exr-e_standardknockout2 by including the hedge in @exr-e_standardknockout3.  Value the down-and-in call using the function `Down_And_Out_Call` and the fact that a down-and-out and down-and-in with the same strikes and barriers form a standard option. \n:::\n::: {#exr-e_averagehedge}\n  Each week you purchase 100 units of an asset, and you want to hedge your total quarterly (13-week) cost.  Create a Python program simulating the asset price and comparing the quality of the following hedges: \n\n\n\n1. a standard European call maturing at the end of the quarter ($T=0.25$) on 1300 units of the asset, \n2. 13 call options maturing at the end of each week of the quarter, each written on 100 units of the asset, and \n3. a discretely sampled average-price call with maturity $T=0.25$ written on 1300 units of the asset, where the sampling is at the end of each week.  \n4. a discretely sampled geometric-average-price call with maturity $T=0.25$ written on 1300 units of the asset, where the sampling is at the end of each week.\n\n\nAllow the user to input $S$, $r$, $\\sigma$ and $q$.  Assume all of the options are at the money at the beginning of the quarter ($K=S$).  Compare the hedges as in @exr-e_standardknockout.\n:::\n::: {#exr-e_averagehedge2}\n In the setting of the previous problem, compute the prices of the options in parts (a), (b) and (d).  Modify the simulations in the previous problem to compare the end-of-quarter costs including the costs of the options (adding interest on the option prices to put everything on an end-of-quarter basis).\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Using the put-call parity relation, derive a formula for the value of a forward-start put.\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Derive @eq-callonaput for the value of a call on a put.\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Complete the derivation of @eq-chooser2 for the value of a chooser option.\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Derive a formula for the value of a put option on the maximum of two risky asset prices.\n:::\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Using the result of the preceding exercise and Margrabe's formula, verify that calls and puts (having the same strike $K$ and maturity $T$) on the maximum of two risky asset prices satisfy the following put-call parity relation:\n\\begin{multline*}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-rT}K + \\text{Value of call on max} \\\\\n= \\mathrm{e}^{-q_2T}S_2(0) + \\text{Value of option to exchange asset 2 for asset 1} \\\\+ \\text{Value of put on max}\\;.\n\\end{multline*}\n:::\n\n",
