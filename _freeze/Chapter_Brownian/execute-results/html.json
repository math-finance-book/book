A Brownian motion is a random process (a variable that changes randomly over time) that evolves continuously in time and has the property that its change over any time period is normally distributed with a zero mean and variance equal to the length of the time period.  The mean-zero feature means that a Brownian motion is a martingale.  We will also give a different characterization (Levy's theorem) emphasizing the quadratic variation process, which is a property of the paths (how the variable evolves over time, in a given state of the world) of the process.  \n\nThe second objective is to explain Ito's formula, which is the chain rule for stochastic calculus.  In the Black-Scholes model, the stock price is assumed to satisfy\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} S}{S}=\\mu\\,\\mathrm{d} t+\\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B\\; ,$$\nwhere $B$ is a Brownian motion.  In the case that the stock pays no dividend, the rate of return is $\\mathrm{d} S/S$. The two terms on the right-hand side represent the mean rate of return and the risk, respectively.  \n\nThis model can be equivalently written in terms of the natural logarithm of $S$, which we will write as $\\log S$.  The above equation for the rate of return is equivalent to\n$$\\mathrm{d}\\,\\log S = \\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d} t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B\\; .$$\nWe will explain this equivalence and other similar calculations that are useful for pricing derivatives.\n\nThe third objective is to explain how, when we change numeraires, as described in the previous chapter, we can calculate the expectation in the fundamental pricing @eq-formula.  The question is what effect does changing the numeraire (and hence the probability measure) have on the distribution of an asset price.  \n\nEverything in the remainder of the book is based on the mathematics presented in this chapter.  For easy reference, the essential formulas have been highlighted in boxes.  \n\n\n\n\n## Brownian Paths {#sec-s_simulatingbrownian}\n\nWe begin with the fact that changes in the value of a Brownian motion \\index{Brownian motion} are normally distributed with a zero mean and variance equal to the length of the time period.  Let $B(t)$ denote the value of a Brownian motion at time $t$.  Then for any date $u>t$, given the information at time $t$, the random variable $B(u) - B(t)$ is normally distributed with a zero mean and variance equal to $u-t$.  Unless stated otherwise, our convention will be that a Brownian motion starts at $B(0)=0$.\n\nWe can generate an approximate Brownian motion in Python.  To do so, we take a small time period $\\Delta t$ and define the value at the end of the period to be the value of the Brownian motion at the beginning plus a normally distributed variable with mean 0 and variance $\\Delta t$.  In the following procedure, we input the length $T=0.5$ of the entire time period over which the Brownian motion is to be simulated.  One input the is number $n=10000$ of time periods of length $\\Delta t$ within the full interval $[0,T]$.  The length $\\Delta t$ of each individual time period is then calculated as $T/n$.  The quality of the approximation of this simulation to a true Brownian motion will be always be improved by increasing the number $n$.  Plotting the output of the procedure creates a picture of what we call a path of the Brownian motion, which means that it shows the value taken at each time in one state of the world.  The procedure generates $m=2$ paths which can be interpreted as the values of the Brownian motion in another state of the world.  In other words, the path of the Brownian motion is itself random, depending in this approximation on the numbers produced by Python's random number generating function.  The random number generator np.random.normal(loc = 0, scale = vol,size = (n,m)) is an algorithm that produces numbers that mimic $n \\times m$ normally distributed random variables with mean 0 (loc=0) and standard deviation $\\sqrt{\\Delta t}$ (scale=vol).  By setting the seed=1234 the generator is initialized and we will always get the same output whenever we run the code. The Brownian path is just the cumulative sum of the normal increments.  @fig-brownian-path\n\n::: {#cell-fig-brownian-path .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as

the preceding section, we will see the distinctive characteristic of a Brownian motion: it jiggles rapidly, moving up and down in a very erratic way.  The name Brownian motion derives from the botanist Robert Brown's observations of the erratic behavior of particles suspended in a fluid.  This has long been thought to be a reasonable model for the behavior of a stock price. The plot of other functions with which we may be familiar will be much smoother.  This is captured in the concept of quadratic variation.  \n\nConsider a discrete partition \n$$0=t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < \\cdots < t_N=T$$\nof the time interval $[0,T]$.  Let $B$ be a Brownian motion and calculate the sum of squared changes\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^N [\\Delta B_{t_i}]^2\\; ,$$\nwhere $\\Delta B_{t_i}$ denotes the change $B_{t_i}-B(t_{i-1}).$  If we consider finer partitions with the length of each time interval $t_i-t_{i-1}$ going to zero, the limit of the sum is called the quadratic variation of the process.  \\index{quadratic variation} For a Brownian motion, the quadratic variation over an interval $[0,t]$ is equal to $t$ with probability one.  Here is a plot of the quadratic variation of the previous approximation of a Brownian motion.  The plot shows that the approximation has quadratic variation through each date $t$ that is approximately equal to $t$.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-quadratic-variation .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python

If $X$ is a continuously differentiable function of time (in each state of the world), then the quadratic variation of $X$ will be zero.  A simple example is a linear function: $X(t) = at$ for some constant $a$.  Then, taking $t_i-t_{i-1} = \\Delta t = T/N$ for each $i$, the sum of squared changes is\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^N [\\Delta X_{t_i}]^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^N  [a\\,\\Delta t]^2 = Na^2 (\\Delta t)^2 = Na^2 \\left(\\frac{T}{N}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2T^2}{N} \\rightarrow 0$$\nas $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.  Essentially the same argument shows that the quadratic variation of any continuously differentiable function is zero, because such a function is approximately linear at each point.  Thus, the jiggling of a Brownian motion, which leads to the nonzero quadratic variation, is quite unusual.  To explain exactly how unusual it is, it is helpful to introduce the concept of total variation, \\index{total variation} which is defined in the same way as quadratic variation but with the squared changes $[\\Delta B_{t_i}]^2$ replaced by the absolute value of the changes $|\\Delta B_{t_i}|.$  If the quadratic variation of a continuous function is nonzero, then its total variation is necessarily infinite, so each path of a Brownian motion has infinite total variation (with probability one).  It was mentioned above that, with a large number of time steps in the simulation of the preceding section, one could see the distinctive jiggling property of a Brownian motion.  This is not quite right.  Any plot drawn by a pencil (or a laser printer, for that matter) must have finite total variation, because the total variation is the total distance traveled by the pencil.  Hence, no matter how many time steps one uses, one will never create a continuous plot with the nonzero quadratic variation (and infinite total variation) that a Brownian path has.  Another way to understand this is to consider focusing on a small segment of a plot and viewing it with a magnifying glass.  If the segment is small enough, and excluding the finite number of kinks that a pencil can draw in the plot of a function, it will look approximately like a straight line under the magnifying glass (with slope equal to the derivative of the function).  However, if one could view a segment of a path of a true Brownian motion under a magnifying glass, it would look much the same as the entire picture does to the naked eye---no matter how small the segment, one would still see the characteristic jiggling.\n\n\nTo better visualize the convergence of the quadratic variation of a handful of simulated paths of a standard Brownian motion, we encourage readers to interact with the plot below.\n\n::: {#fig-interactive_quad_var}\n<iframe wi\\,\\mathrm{d} th=\"780\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://derivatives-book-26ac36570fb8.herokuapp.com/math_finance_book_plots/quad_var_plot\"></iframe>\n\nConvergence of quadratic variation for a standard Brownian motion\n:::\n\nOne may well question why we should be interested in this curious mathematical object.  The reason is that asset pricing inherently involves martingales (variables that evolve randomly over time in such a way that their expected changes are always zero), as our fundamental pricing formula (@eq-formula) establishes.  Furthermore, continuous processes (variables whose paths are continuous functions of time) are much more tractable mathematically than are processes that can jump at some instants.  More importantly, it is possible in a mathematical model with continuous processes to define perfect hedges much more readily than it is in a model involving jump processes.  So, we are led to a study of continuous martingales.  An important fact is that any non-constant continuous martingale must have infinite total variation!  So, the normal functions with which we are familiar are left behind once we enter the study of continuous martingales.  \n\nThere remains perhaps the question of why we focus on Brownian motion within the world of continuous martingales.  The answer here is that any continuous martingale is really just a transformation of a Brownian motion.  This is a consequence of the following important fact, which is known as Levy's theorem: \\index{Levy's theorem}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## \nA continuous martingale is a Brownian motion if and only if its quadratic variation over each interval $[0,T]$ equals $T$.\n:::\n\nThus, among continuous martingales, a Brownian motion is defined by the condition that the quadratic variation over each interval $[0,T]$ is equal to $T$.  This is really just a normalization.  A different continuous martingale may have a different quadratic variation, but it can be converted to a Brownian motion just by deforming the time scale.  Furthermore, many continuous martingales can be constructed as stochastic integrals with respect to a Brownian motion.  We take up this topic in the next section.\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n\n::: {#exr-nolabel}\n Consider a discrete partition $0=t_0 < t_1 < \\cdots t_N=T$ of the time interval $[0,T]$ with $t_i - t_{i-1} = \\Delta t = T/N$ for each $i$.
