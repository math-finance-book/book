The columns of that data are:\n\n- Strike: the price at which the owner of a call (put) can buy (sell) the underlying asset.\n- Bid price: the price at which we can sell an option. The price at which we buy or sell an option is called the option premium to distinguish it from the strike price of the option, which is the price at which we can buy or sell the underlying asset if we own the option.\n- Ask price: the price at which we can buy an option.\n- Last price: the last price (premium) at which the option traded.\n- Change: the change in price over the course of the day.\n- Time of last trade: the day and time at which the option last traded.\n- Volume: the number of contracts traded during the day.  Each contract is for 100 shares of the underlying asset.\n- Open interest: The number of contracts for which there are currently outstanding positions.\n\nThe exchange determines the maturity dates and strike prices that can be traded.  As time passes and options mature, new maturity dates are introduced for trading.  As time passes and trading interest may increase, new strikes are introduced also.  New strikes are also introduced when the underlying asset price changes in order to keep the current price bracketed by traded strikes. The number of maturities and strikes traded varies by asset and depends on the exchange's assessment of trading interest.\n\nThe bid price is the highest price at which other traders are willing to buy (it is what traders are bidding for the option, as in bidding to buy a house), so it is the price at which we can sell an option if we submit an order to sell at the market price (called a market order).\n\nThe ask price is the lowest price at which others are willing to sell (similar in concept to asking a certain price for a house you want to sell).  Thus, it is the price at which we can buy with a market order.  The price we have to pay to buy (the ask) is always larger than the price at which we can sell (the bid), and  the difference between the ask price and the bid price is called the bid-ask spread.  \n\nAn alternative to submitting a market order and trading at the bid or ask is to submit a limit order.  A limit order specifies a limit price: a buyer will not pay more than her specified limit price, and a seller will not receive less than her specified limit price.  If we submit a limit order to buy, then we join the queue of bidders.  Eventually, our bid may become the best bid and we are able to transact with a market sell order, trading at our bid price.  The advantage is that trading at our bid price is cheaper than paying the market ask, but the downside is that the limit order may never execute. \n\nOptions are unlike stocks in that there is no outstanding supply of ownership interests to trade.  When a maturity/strike is first introduced for trading, there are no outstanding positions in it; that is, open interest is zero.  If there is a trade for one contract, then open interest becomes equal to one.  In each trade, there is of course a buyer and a seller.  People can sell options that they bought previously, or they can sell options without owning any of the option.  The latter is obviously true for the first trade.  Someone who has bought an option is said to be long the option, and someone who has net sold the option is said to be short.  At any point in time, the number of long contracts is equal to the number of short contracts and is called open interest.\n\nWhen a trade is made on an exchange, the exchange clearinghouse becomes the counterparty to both sides.  For example, anyone who is long a call option has an option to buy the underlying asset at the strike *from the clearinghouse*.  Simlarly, anyone who is short a call option has an obligation to deliver the underlying asset *to the clearinghouse* and receive the strike, should the clearinghouse exercise the option.  The clearinghouse exercises options when an option of the same strike and maturity is exercised against it.  This causes the underlying asset to be passed through the clearinghouse from the short party to the long party when the long party exercises.  The strike is passed through in the opposite direction.  The short party against whom the clearinghouse exercises is chosen randomly among the people who are short that particular option.  The risk of a short party defaulting when an option is exercised is thus borne by the clearinghouse.  The clearinghouse wishes to minimize this risk and therefore requires a seller of an option to post collateral in a margin account.  This procedure provides the long party assurance that the option will be honored, which would otherwise be impossible with anonymous trade.  It also makes it possible for contracts to be cancelled by making offsetting trades with a different counterparty than the counterparty to the original trade.\n\nThe reader is encouraged to experiment with Figure~1 to look for patterns in bid and ask prices, the time of the last trade, volume, and open interest across strikes, maturities, and underlying assets.  We should see the following:\n\n- For call (put) options, bid and ask prices are smaller (larger) when the strike is larger.\n- For both call and put options, bid and ask prices are larger when the maturity date is further away.\n- Volume and open interest is concentrated in strikes near the current price of the underlying asset.\n- Volume is generally larger when the maturity date is nearer.\n- The last trade date is generally further in the past for strikes further away from the current price of the underlying asset.\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-options-market-data} \n<iframe height=\"900\" width =\"720\" src=\"https://options-market-data.koyeb.app/\"></iframe>\n\n**Market options data courtesy of Yahoo Finance.** If the left sidebar with controls for ticker, call versus put, and maturity is not visible, use the {{<chevron-right>}} at the very top of the figure to open it.\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe second column of the table shows the bid prices. \n\n::: Example\nSuppose you want to buy an option, and you submit a limit order with a price of $5.00. Of course, you will be happy to buy at a lower price also.  If the current market ask price is $4.90, then your order will execute immediately at $4.90.  On the other hand, if the market is trading at a bid of $5.10 and an ask of $5.25, then you cannot immediately buy at $5.00 or less, so your limit order will join the queue of limit orders, called the limit order book.  If the market for the option rises, then you will never be able to buy at $5.00, and your order will never execute.  However, if the market falls, then your $5.00 order will eventually become the best bid and execute against an incoming market sell order.\n:::\n\nFor call options, bid and ask prices are lower for higher strikes.  It is better to have the right to buy AAPL at $100 a share than to have the right to buy it at $200 per share, so the market price of the former is higher than the price of the latter.\n\nThe fourth column of the table shows the most recent transaction price.  For strikes away from the current AAPL price, the most recent transaction may have been several days ago.  The change and %change are the changes during the current trading day relative to the last price of the prior day (more precisely, it is relative to the settlement price, which is discussed below).  The volume is the number of contracts traded on the most recent day on which the strike traded.  Implied volatility, shown in the last column, is discussed in @sec-c:blackscholes.\n\n\nThe following are some basic uses of options.  Other standard option portfolios are presented in Exercises~\\ref{p_bullspread} and~\\ref{p_straddle}.\n\n\\setlength{\\parskip}{\\baselineskip}\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[\\textbf{Protective Puts}] \\index{protective put} An owner of an asset may buy a put option on it. The payoff of the asset combined with a put is\n    $$S_T + \\max(0,K-S_T) = \\max(S_T,K)\\,.$$\n    This reflects the fact that the owner can obtain at least~$K$ by exercising the put; thus, the put is insurance for the underlying asset.  Similarly, someone who is short the underlying asset can buy a call option to insure the short position.\n\\item[\\textbf{Covered Calls}]  \\index{covered call} An owner of an asset may sell a call option on it. The payoff of the asset combined with a short call is\n    $$S_T - \\max(0,S_T-K) = S_T + \\min(0,K-S_T) = \\min(S_T,K)\\,.$$\n    This means that the upside is capped at~$K$.  In exchange for accepting this cap, the seller of the call receives income (the option premium).  The call is said to be covered because the seller owns the underlying and hence will not have to buy it in the market to deliver if the call is exercised.  If the seller does not own the underlying, the call is said to be naked.  Similarly, someone who is short the underlying asset might sell a put for income.\n\\item[\\textbf{Leverage}]  Buying a call is similar to buying the underlying on margin. This is shown explicitly in Section~\\ref{s_op_hedging}.  Very high leverage (and very high risk) can be created by buying options.  Unlike someone who buys on margin, the buyer of a call has no default risk.  In practice, this often makes it possible to obtain higher leverage by buying calls than by buying the underlying asset on margin.  Similarly, buying a put is an alternative to short selling, and higher leverage can be obtained by buying puts than by short selling the underlying asset.   \n\\item[\\textbf{Trading Volatility}] A straddle is a put and a call with the same strike.  It will profit if the underlying moves in either direction from the strike.  Someone who buys straddles is buying volatility, and someone who sells straddles is selling volatility.  \n\\end{description}\n\n## Intrinsic Value and Time Value\n\n\n\n\n\n## Investing in Options\n\n\n## Hedging with Options\n\n\n## Selling Options for Income\n\n\n## Option Spreads\n\n\n::: {#fig-option_portfolios fig-cap=\"The value at maturity of a portfolio of options is plotted, assuming all of the options have the same maturity.
