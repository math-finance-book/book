We build other stochastic processes using those changes.  The general idea is\n$$\\text{change} = \\text{mean} + \\text{std dev} \\times \\text{change in Brownian motion}\\,.$$\nThe mathematical foundations for our construction were created by K. Ito.  The key concepts are the Ito integral, Ito processes, and Ito's formula (also called Ito's lemma).  Using these foundations, we can build quite general processes from changes in Brownian motions, including processes with non-normal distributions.\n\n## Examples {#sec-s:discreteito}\n\nWe begin with some simple examples.  Consider a discrete partition of a time interval:\n$$0=t_0 < t_1< \\cdots < t_{n-1} < t_n=t$$\nwith equally spaced times.  Let $\\Delta t$ denote the difference between successive times.  \n\nFirst, let's drop the randomness entirely.  Consider the equation\n$$X_{t_i} -  X_{t_{i-1}} = \\mu X_{t_{i-1}}\\Delta t$$ {#eq-ito_discrete_1}\nfor a constant $\\mu$.  Thus, we have \"change $\\,=\\,$ mean,\" where the mean is proportional to the previous value with proportionality factor $\\mu \\Delta t$.  @fig-discrete-interest presents a plot of $X$, for particular values of $X_0$, $\\mu$, and $\\Delta t$.\n\nIf we increase $n$, making $\\Delta t$ smaller, then $X$ converges to the solution of the ordinary differential equation\n$$\\d X_t = \\mu X_t\\d  t\\,.$$ {#eq-ito_discrete_2}\n@eq-ito_discrete_2 has a known solution, which is \n$$X_t = X_0 \\e^{\\mu t}\\,.$$ {#eq-ito_discrete_3}\nTo verify this, we only need to differentiate $X$ defined in @eq-ito_discrete_3:\n$$\\frac{\\d X_t}{\\d t} = \\mu X_0 \\e^{\\mu t} = \\mu X_t\\,.$$\nThe function presented in @eq-ito_discrete_3 is also shown in @fig-discrete-interest.\n\n::: Extra\n\nTo see how one might guess that @eq-ito_discrete_3 is the solution of @eq-ito_discrete_2, we can examine the logarithm of $X$.  A general rule gives us $\\d \\log X = \\d X / X$, so $\\d \\log X = \\mu \\d t$.  We can integrate both sides of this to obtain $\\log X_t - \\log X_0 = \\mu t$.  Now, rearranging and exponentiating gives $X_t = X_0\\e^{\\mu t}$.  Later, we follow similar steps to see that @eq-ito_discrete_6 is the solution of @eq-ito_discrete_5.\n:::\n\n::: {#cell-fig-discrete-interest .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport

Let's make the noise proportional to the value of $X$,  So, let $B$ be a standard Brownian motion and consider the equation\n$$X_{t_i} - X_{t_{i-1}} = \\mu X_{t_{i-1}}\\Delta t + \\sigma X_{t_{i-1}} \\Delta B_{t_i}$$ {#eq-ito_discrete_4}\nwhere $\\sigma$ is another constant, and $\\Delta B_{t_i} = B_{t_i} - B_{t_{i-1}}$.  A solution $X$ of this equation  has random paths, due to the random noise $\\Delta B_{t_i}$.  An example of a path is shown in @fig-discrete-random.\nIto showed how we can take the limit of this equation as we make $\\Delta t$ smaller and make sense of the equation\n$$\n\\d X_t = \\mu X_t\\d  t + \\sigma X_t \\d  B_t\\,.\n$$ {#eq-ito_discrete_5}\nThe solution $X$ of @eq-ito_discrete_5 is\n$$X_t = \\e^{(\\mu  - \\sigma^2/2)t + \\sigma B_t}\\,.$$ {#eq-ito_discrete_6}\nAn approximate path of this process $X$ is also shown in @fig-discrete-random.  It is generated by taking $\\Delta t$ very small, just as we generated approximate paths of Brownian motions in @sec-c:brownian.  We can show that $X$ defined in @eq-ito_discrete_6 satisfies @eq-ito_discrete_5 by differentiating, as we showed that $X$ defined in @eq-ito_discrete_3 satisfies @eq-ito_discrete_2.

The solution of the difference equation is shown with linear interpolation.\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe functions and processes $X$ defined in this section have important interpretations.  @eq-ito_discrete_1 can be rewritten to say that the percent change in $X$ is $\\mu \\Delta t$.  This could represent the value of a savings account that earns interest of $\\mu \\Delta t$ in each period of length $\\Delta t$.  This is the common way of calculating, for example, monthly interest, where $\\mu$ is called the annual rate of interest and $\\Delta t$ would be $1/12$.  The limiting @eq-ito_discrete_3 is called continuous compounding of interest.\n\nSimilarly, @eq-ito_discrete_4 can be rewritten to say that the percent change in $X$ is $\\mu \\Delta t + \\sigma \\Delta B$.  This represents a random rate of return -- for example, the return of a stock.  The expected rate of return in this case is $\\mu \\Delta t$, and the variance of the rate of return is $\\sigma^2 \\Delta t$.  The limiting @eq-ito_discrete_3 is called continuous compounding of returns.\n\n\n\n## Ito Processes {#sec-s:itoprocesses}\n\nThe meaning of @eq-ito_discrete_2 is that, for all $t  > 0$,\n$$X_t = X_0 +  \\int_0^t \\mu X_s \\d s\\,.$$\nWe assume the reader is familiar with integrals, so we do not explain this further.  The function of time $X$ defined in @eq-ito_discrete_3 satisfies this equation.  Similarly, the meaning of @eq-ito_discrete_5 is that, for all $t > 0$,\n$$X_t = X_0 +  \\int_0^t \\mu X_s \\d s + \\int_0^t \\sigma X_s \\d B_s\\,.$$\nThe first integral in this formula is an ordinary integral.  The second is an Ito integral, which is to be explained.  The sum of an ordinary integral and an Ito integral is called an Ito process.  An Ito process always has continuous paths. \n\nLet's depart from the example of the previous section and consider a process $X$ satisfying, for all $t>0$,\n$$X_t = \\int_0^t \\alpha_s\\d s + \\int_0^t \\theta_s \\d B_s\\,.$${#eq-ito1}\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$ can be stochastic processes.  The example of the previous section fits this form, because we could take $\\alpha_s = \\mu X_s$ and $\\theta_s = \\sigma X_s$.  The definition of the Ito integral\n$$\\int_0^t \\theta_s \\d B_s$$\nis relatively complicated.  It is enough for our purposes to know that it can be approximated by a  discrete sum\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\theta_{t_{i-1}}(B_{t_i} - B_{t_{i-1}})\\,,$$\ngiven a partition\n$$ 0 = t_0 < \\cdots < t_n = t\\,,$$\nwhen $n$ is large and the time between successive dates is small.  The Ito integral exists provided $\\theta$ does not anticipate the future (so $\\theta_{t_{i-1}}$ is independent of the increment $B_{t_i}- B_{t_{i-1}}$) and provided $\\theta$ does not explode to $\\pm \\infty$ in finite time, so \n$$\\int_0^t \\theta_s^2 \\d s < \\infty$$\nfor all $t > 0$, with probability one.\n\nWe also write @eq-ito1 as\n$$\n\\d X_t = \\alpha_t\\d t + \\theta_t \\d B_t\\,. \n$${#eq-ito2}\nWe interpret this as \"change $=$ mean $+$ noise\" with $\\alpha_t \\d t$ being the mean and $\\theta_t\\d B_t$ being the mean-zero random noise.    The quantity $\\alpha_t$  is also called the drift of the process $X$ at time $t$.   \\index{drift} The coefficient $\\sigma_t$ is called the diffusion coefficient of $X$ at time $t$.  \\index{diffusion coefficient}\nIf $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$ are constant, it is standard to refer to an Ito process $X$ as a $(\\alpha,\\theta)$--Brownian motion.  When they are constant, we obtain\n$$X_t= X_0 + \\alpha t + \\theta B_t\\,.$$\n\nAn Ito process as in @eq-ito1 can be a martingale only if $\\alpha=0$.  This should seem sensible, because $\\alpha\\d  t$ is the expected change in $X$, and a process is a martingale only if its expected change is zero.   This observation plays a fundamental role in deriving asset pricing formulas.  Conversely, if $\\alpha=0$ and \n$$\n\\E \\left[\\int_0^t \\theta^2_s\\d   s\\right] < \\infty\n$$ {#eq-regularity1}\nfor each $t$, then the Ito process is a continuous martingale, and the variance of its date--$t$ value, calculated with the information available at date $0$, is:\n$$\\mathrm{var}(X_t) = \\E \\left[\\int_0^t \\theta^2_t\\d  s\\right]\\; .$$  \n\n## Quadratic and Joint Variation of  Ito Processes\n\nThe quadratic variation of the Ito process $X$ defined in @eq-ito2 through each date $t$ is \n$$\n\\int_0^t \\theta^2_s\\d  s\n$$ \nwith probability one.  In fact, when @eq-regularity1 holds, a somewhat more precise definition of the stochastic integral is the (unique) martingale with quadratic variation given by @eq-itoquadraticvariation.\n\nTo compute the quadratic variation of an Ito process, we use the following simple and important rules (for the sake of brevity, we drop the subscript $t$ from $B_t$ here and sometimes later).  These rules should be regarded as mnemonic devices.  The calculations we do with them lead to the correct results, but the objects have no real mathematical meaning.\n\n::: Rule\n## \n\n\n$$\n(\\d  t)^2 = 0\\;, \n$$ {#eq-dtsquared}\n\n$$\n(\\d  t)(\\d  B) =0\\;, \n$$ {#eq-dB}\n\n$$\n(\\d  B)^2 =\\d  t\\;. \n$$ {#eq-dBsquared}\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\nWe apply these rules to compute the quadratic variation of $X$ as follows:\n\n::: Rule\n## \nIf $\\d  X = \\alpha\\d   t + \\theta\\d   B$ for a Brownian motion $B$, then\n\\begin{align*}\n(\\d  X)^2 &= (\\alpha\\d   t+\\theta\\d   B)^2\\\\\n&= \\alpha^2(\\d  t)^2 + 2\\alpha\\theta(\\d  t)(\\d  B) + \\theta^2(\\d  B)^2\\\\\n&= \\theta^2\\d   t\\;.\n\\end{align*}\n:::\n\nWe integrate $(\\d X)^2$ over a time interval to compute the quadratic variation of $X$ over that period as:\n$$\n\\int_0^t (\\d  X_s)^2 = \\int_0^t \\theta^2_s\\d   s\\;.\n$$ {#eq-itoquadraticvariation2}\nIn a more formal mathematical presentation, one normally writes $\\d \\langle X,X\\rangle$ for what we are writing here as $(\\d  X)^2$.

As with squaring differentials, taking products of differentials is a mnemonic device to get us to the correct formula.\n\n## Introduction to Ito's Formula {#sec-s:itosformula}\n\nFirst we recall some facts of the ordinary calculus.  If $y=f(x)$ and $x_t = g(t)$ with $f$ and $g$ being continuously differentiable functions, then \n$$\\frac{\\d  y}{\\d  t} = \\frac{\\d  y}{\\d  x}\\times \\frac{\\d  x}{\\d  t} = f'(x_t)g'(t)\\; .$$\nThis implies that, for each $t>0$,\n$$y_t = f(x_t) = y_0 + \\int_0^t \\frac{\\d  y}{\\d  s}\\d   s = y_0 + \\int_0^t f'(x_s)g'(s)\\d   s\\; .$$\nSubstituting $\\d x_s = g'(s)\\d   s$, we can also write this as\n$$\ny_t = f(x_t) = y_0 + \\int_0^t f'(x_s)\\d   x_s\\,,\n$$ {#eq-ordinarycalculus}\nor, in differential form,\n$$\ndy_t = f'(x_t)\\d x_t \\,.\n$$ {#eq-ordinarycalculus2}\nWhat people frequently remember about integrals from their calculus courses is that there are a lot of tricky substitutions that can be made to simplify the calculation of various integrals.  We won't need those in this book.  All we will use are equations of the form of @eq-ordinarycalculus, which is a special case of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which says that a function is the integral of its derivative.  Intuitively, we can think of @eq-ordinarycalculus as saying that the change in $y$ over a discrete interval (from $0$ to $t$) is the continuous sum (integral) of its infinitesimal changes.  \n\nLet's contrast  @eq-ordinarycalculus  with a special case of Ito's formula for the calculus of Ito processes.  If $B$ is a Brownian motion and $Y = f(B)$ for a twice-continuously differentiable function $f$, then \n$$\\d   Y_t = f'(B_t)\\d   B_t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(B_t)\\d   t  \\,. \n$$ {#eq-ito0}\nComparing @eq-ito0 to @eq-ordinarycalculus2, we see that Ito's formula has an extra term involving the second derivative $f''$.   \n\n@eq-ito0 implies that $Y=f(B)$ is an Ito process with drift $f''(B_t)/2$ and diffusion coefficient $f'(B_t)$.  The real meaning of @eq-ito0 is the integrated form:\n$$\nY_t = f(B_t) = Y_0 + \\int_0^t f'(B_s)\\d   B_s + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t f''(B_s)\\d   s\\;.\n$$ {#eq-itonew1}\nThus, the change in $Y$ over a discrete interval is again the continuous sum of its infinitesimal changes, but now the infinitesimal changes are given by @eq-ito0.  Note that the first integral in @eq-itonew1 is an Ito integral.\n\nTo gain some intuition for the extra term in Ito's formula, we return to the ordinary calculus.  Given dates $s<t$, the derivative defines a linear approximation of the change in $y$ from $s$ to $t$; that is, setting $\\Delta x = x_t-x_s$ and $\\Delta y = y_t - y_s$, we have the approximation\n$$\\Delta y \\approx f'(x_s) \\,\\Delta x\\; .$$\nA better approximation is given by the second-order Taylor series expansion\n$$\\Delta y \\approx f'(x_s)\\,\\Delta x + \\frac{1}{2} f''(x_s)\\,(\\Delta x)^2\\; .$$\nAn interpretation of  @eq-ordinarycalculus is that the linear approximation works perfectly for infinitesimal time periods $\\d  s$, because we can compute the change in $y$ over the time interval $[0,t]$ by summing up the infinitesimal changes $f'(x_s)\\d   x_s$.  In other words, the second-order term $\\frac{1}{2} f''(x_s)\\,(\\Delta x)^2$ vanishes when we consider very short time periods.\n\nThe second-order Taylor series expansion in the case of $Y=f(B)$ is \n$$\\Delta Y \\approx f'(B_s)\\,\\Delta B + \\frac{1}{2} f''(B_s)\\,(\\Delta B)^2\\; .$$\nFor example, given a partition $0=t_0 < t_1 < \\cdots < t_n=t$ of the time interval $[0,t]$, we have, with the same notation we have used earlier,\n\n$$\nY_t = Y_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\Delta Y_{t_i}  \n\\approx Y_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^n f'(B_{t_{i-1}})\\,\\Delta B_{t_i} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n f''(B_{t_{i-1}})\\,(\\Delta B_{t_i})^2\\;.\n$$ {#eq-itonew2}\n\n\nIf we make the time intervals $t_i-t_{i-1}$ shorter, letting $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, then we cannot expect that the extra term here will disappear, leading to the result  of the ordinary calculus shown in @eq-ordinarycalculus, because we know that\n$$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\Delta B_{t_i})^2 = t\\; ,$$\nwhereas for the continuously differentiable function $x_t = g(t)$, the same limit is zero.  In fact it seems sensible to interpret the limit of $(\\Delta B)^2$ as $(\\d  B)^2 =\\d  t$.\nThis is perfectly consistent with Ito's formula: if we take the limit in @eq-itonew2, replacing the limit of $(\\Delta B_{t_i})^2$ with $(\\d  B)^2 = \\d  t$, we obtain @eq-itonew1.\n\nTo see the accuracy of Ito's approximation over different time steps, as well as the impact of the second-derivative term $\\int_0^t (1/2)f''(B_s)\\d s$, we encourage readers to interact with the plot below.  It examines the function $f(x)=\\e^{x}$ (for which we have $f'(x)=\\e^x$ and $f''(x) = \\e^x$).  It simulates an approximate path of a Brownian motion as we have done before.  It then compares the true value of $\\e^{B_{t_i}}$ to the Ito expansion \n$$\\e^{B_t}=1 + \\int_0^t \\e^{B_s} \\d B_s + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t \\e^{B_s} \\d s$$\nusing the discretization \n$$\\Delta \\e^{B_{t_i}}= \\e^{B_{t_{i-1}}} \\Delta B_{t_i} + \\frac{1}{2} \\e^{B_{t_{i-1}}} \\Delta t \\,.$$\nThe discretization approximates the true value better if we take $n$ larger and $\\Delta t$ smaller.  The important take-away from the figure is that the cumulative second-derivative terms in the discretization \ndo not vanish as we take $n$ larger but instead continue to contribute significantly to the approximation.\n\n\n::: {#fig-interactive_ito fig-cap=\"Accuracy of Ito Approximation\"}\n<iframe width=\"780\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://derivatives-book-26ac36570fb8.herokuapp.com/math_finance_book_plots/ito_approx_plot\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n## Ito's Formula for Functions of Brownian Motion\n\nWe extend the example in the previous section slightly.\nConsider a process $Y$ defined as $Y_t = f(t, B_t)$ for some function $f$.
