For example, $X_t$ might denote how much wealth you have at time $t$.  Partition the interval $[0,T]$ into $N$ intervals of length $\\Delta t = \\frac{T}{N}$, in other words\n $$[0, \\Delta t = \\frac{T}{N}, 2 \\Delta t, ..., (N-1) \\Delta t, N \\Delta t =T].$$\n\nIf you invest your wealth $X((i-1)\\Delta t)$ at a fixed rate of interest $r \\Delta t$ over a period of length $\\Delta t=\\frac{T}{N}$, you will have $X((i-1)\\Delta t) (1+ r \\Delta t)$ at the end of the period; the change of your wealth from $(i-1)\\Delta t$ to $t = i\\Delta t$ is \n$$\n\\Delta X_t = X(i \\Delta t)-X((i-1) \\Delta t)=(1+r \\Delta t) X((i-1) \\Delta t) - X_t= r X_t \\Delta t.\n$$  \nThe limiting form of this equation is \n$$\n X_t = r X_t \\,\\mathrm{d} t ~~~\\text{or} ~~~\\frac{d X_t}{\\,\\mathrm{d} t} = r X_t\n$$ \n\nwhich is a differential equation.  Notice this can also be written as a sum \n\n$$X(N \\Delta t) =X_0+ \\sum_{i=0}^N (X(i \\Delta t)-X((i-1)\\Delta t)) = X_0 + \\sum_{i=0}^{N} r X((i-1)\\Delta t) \\Delta t ; \n$$\n\nin the limit we get an integral equation\n\n$$X_t = X_0 + \\int_0^T r X_t \\,\\mathrm{d} t.$$\n\n  The solution is $X_t = X_0 e^{r T}$ which is easily verified by taking the derivative $\\frac{d}{\\,\\mathrm{d} t}e^{r t} X_t = r X_t$ or by inserting the solution into the integral equation. This is also the limiting value of the discretely compunded interest as the number of compounding periods $n$ goes to infinity: \n\n$$X_t=\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(1+r \\frac{T}{N}\\right)^{N}.$$ \n\nThis can be verified by taking the log of $\\left(1+r \\frac{T}{N}\\right)^{N}$ and using l'Hospital's rule.  Given the initial wealth, $X_0$ and the rate of change $r X_t$ (which, if the unit of account is dollars, is in units dollars / time), we can we  solve for the value of our wealth at all times. \n\nHowever, most investments involve risk.  We might think that part of the return is more or less known while a portion of the investment is random or risky.  Therefore we would like a model which can be written as \n$$ \\d X_t = \\mu X_t \\,\\mathrm{d} t + \\text{`noise'} \\times X_t. $$\n\nIt makes sense that the units of the noise should be in the unit of account (dollars) and it should have zero mean but it is not obvious how to make sense of a noisy change over an instant.  In the next section we examine the most popular choice for this model, namely Brownian motion.  Loosely speaking, we can take expectations to get\n\n$$ d \\\\E[X_t]= \\mu \\\\E[X_t] \\,\\mathrm{d} t$$ \n\nwhich gives a solution \n\n$$\\\\E[X_t]=X_0 e^{\\mu T}. $$\n\nSo we can think of this model as a known expected continuously compunded investment at a rate $\\mu$ plus a noisy return.\n\nHistorically, these deterministic mathematics trace back to Issac Newton who developed the classical laws of motion.  The model of noise was developed by Ito to account for random disturbances, such as unpredictable wind gusts,  to a deterministic model, for example, in a model predicting the position of a falling object.\n\n\n## Ito Processes {#sec-s_itoprocesses}\nAn Ito process is a variable $X$ that changes over time as \\index{Ito process}\n$$\n\\mathrm{d} X_t = \\mu_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t+\\sigma_t\\,\\mathrm{d} B_t\\;,\n$$ {#eq-itoprocess}\n\nwhere $B$ is a Brownian motion, and $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ can also be random processes.  Some regularity conditions are needed on $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ which we will omit, except for noting that $\\mu_t$ and $\\sigma_t$ should be known at time $t$.  In particular, constant $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are certainly acceptable.  When we add the changes over time, we get\n$$X_t=X_0 + \\int_0^T\\mu_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t + \\int_0^T\\sigma_t\\,\\mathrm{d} B_t$$\nfor any $T>0$.  There are other types of random processes, in particular, processes that can jump, but we will not consider them in this book.\n\nWe will not formally define the integral $\\int_0^T \\sigma_t\\,\\mathrm{d} B_t$, but it should be understood as being approximately equal to a discrete sum of the form \n$$\\sum_{i=1}^N \\sigma_{t_{i-1}}\\,\\Delta B_{t_i}\\; ,$$\nwhere $0=t_0 < \\cdots t_N=T$ and the time periods $t_i-t_{i-1}$ are small.  Given that we can simulate the changes $\\Delta B_{t_i}$ as random normals, we can approximately simulate the random variable $\\int_0^T \\sigma_t\\,\\mathrm{d} B_t$ and hence we can approximately simulate $X_t$.\n\nAn Ito process evolves continuously over time.  We interpret $\\mu_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t$ as the expected change in $X$ in an instant $\\mathrm{d} t$.  The quantity $\\mu_t$  is also called the drift of the process $X$ at time $t$.   \\index{drift} The coefficient $\\sigma_t$ is called the diffusion coefficient of $X$ at time $t$.  \\index{diffusion coefficient}\n\nIf $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are constant, it is standard to refer to an Ito process $X$ as a $(\\mu,\\sigma)$--Brownian motion.  In this case we have\n$$X_t= \\mu t + \\sigma B_t$$\n\nOf course, it is not a martingale when $\\mu\\neq 0$.  For example, when $\\mu>0$, $X$ tends to increase over time.  However, it has the jiggling property of a Brownian motion, scaled by the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$. \n\nA very important fact is that an Ito process such as @eq-itoprocess can be a martingale only if $\\mu=0$.  This should seem sensible, because $\\mu\\,\\mathrm{d} t$ is the expected change in $X$, and a process is a martingale only if its expected change is zero.^[If the sources of uncertainty in the market can be modeled as Brownian motions, then in fact every martingale is an Ito process with $\\mu=0$.  This is some justification for the assumption we will make in this book, when studying continuous-time models, that all martingales are Ito processes.]   This observation plays a fundamental role in deriving asset pricing formulas, as we will begin to see in @sec-s_girsanov.\nConversely, if $\\mu=0$ and \n$$\n\\\\E \\left[\\int_0^T \\sigma^2_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\right] < \\infty\n$$ {#eq-regularity1}\n\nfor each $T$,  \nthen the Ito process is a continuous martingale and the variance of its date--$T$ value, calculated with the information available at date $0$, is:\n$$\\mathrm{var}[X_t] = \\\\E \\left[\\int_0^T \\sigma^2_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\right]\\; .$$  \n\nWhether $\\mu$ is zero or not, and independently of the assumption @eq-regularity1, the quadratic variation of the Ito process $X$ is \n$$\n\\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^N[\\Delta X_{t_i}]^2 = \\int_0^T \\sigma^2_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t\n$$ {#eq-itoquadraticvariation}\n\nwith probability one.  Thus we obtain (when $\\mu=0$ and @eq-regularity1 holds) a continuous martingale with a different quadratic variation than a Brownian motion via the diffusion function $\\sigma$.  In fact, when @eq-regularity1 holds, a somewhat more precise definition of the stochastic integral is the (unique) martingale with quadratic variation given by @eq-itoquadraticvariation.\n\nTo compute the quadratic variation of an Ito process, we use the following simple and important rules (for the sake of brevity, we drop the $_t$ notation from $B_t$ here and sometimes later):\n\n::: Rule\n## \n\n\n$$\n(\\mathrm{d} t)^2 = 0\\;, \n$$ {#eq-\\,\\mathrm{d} tsquared}\n\n$$\n(\\mathrm{d} t)(\\mathrm{d} B) =0\\;, \n$$ {#eq-\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\,\\mathrm{d} B}\n\n$$\n(\\mathrm{d} B)^2 =\\mathrm{d} t\\;. \n$$ {#eq-\\,\\mathrm{d} Bsquared}\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\nWe apply these rules to compute the quadratic variation of $X$ as follows:\n\n::: Rule\n## \nIf $\\mathrm{d} X = \\mu\\,\\mathrm{d} t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B$ for a Brownian motion $B$, then\n\\begin{align*}\n(\\mathrm{d} X)^2 &= (\\mu\\,\\mathrm{d} t+\\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B)^2\\\\\n&= \\mu^2(\\mathrm{d} t)^2 + 2\\mu\\sigma(\\mathrm{d} t)(\\mathrm{d} B) + \\sigma^2(\\mathrm{d} B)^2\\\\\n&= 0 + 0 + \\sigma^2\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\;.\n\\end{align*}\n:::\n\nWe integrate this from 0 to $T$ to obtain the quadratic variation @eq-itoquadraticvariation over that time period:^[In a more formal mathematical presentation, one normally writes $\\mathrm{d}\\langle X,X\\rangle$ for what we are writing here as $(\\mathrm{d} X)^2$.  This is the differential of the quadratic variation process, and the quadratic variation through date $T$ is\n$$\n\\langle X,X\\rangle _t = \\int_0^T \\mathrm{d}\\langle X,X\\rangle_t = \\int_0^T \\sigma^2_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\;.\n$$]\n$$\n\\int_0^T (\\mathrm{d} X_t)^2 = \\int_0^T \\sigma^2_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\;.\n$$ {#eq-itoquadraticvariation2}\n\n\n\n\n## Ito's Formula {#sec-s_itosformula}\n\nFirst we recall some facts of the ordinary calculus.  If $y=g(x)$ and $x = f_t$ with $f$ and $g$ being continuously differentiable functions, then \n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x}\\times \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x}{\\mathrm{d} t} = g'(x_t)f'_t\\; .$$\nOver a time period $[0,T]$, this implies that\n$$y_t = y_0 + \\int_0^T \\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\,\\mathrm{d} t = y_0 + \\int_0^T g'(x_t)f'_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\; .$$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{d} x_t = f'_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t$, we can also write this as\n$$\ny_t = y_0 + \\int_0^T g'(x_t)\\,\\mathrm{d} x_t\\;.\n$$ {#eq-ordinarycalculus}\n\n\nWe can contrast  @eq-ordinarycalculus  with a special case of Ito's formula for the calculus of Ito processes (the more general formula will be discussed in the next section).  If $B$ is a Brownian motion and $Y = g(B)$ for a twice-continuously differentiable function $g$, then \\index{Ito's formula}\n$$\nY_t = Y_0 + \\int_0^T g'(B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d} B_t + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T g''(B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d} t\\;.\n$$ {#eq-itonew1}\n\nThus, relative to the ordinary calculus, Ito's formula has an extra term involving the second derivative $g''$.  We can write @eq-itonew1 in differential form as\n$$\\,\\mathrm{d} Y_t = \\frac{1}{2}g''(B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d} t + g'(B_t)\\,\\mathrm{d} B_t.$$\nThus, $Y=g(B)$ is an Ito process with drift $g''(B_t)/2$ and diffusion coefficient $g'(B_t)$.\n\nTo gain some intuition for the extra term in Ito's formula, we return to the ordinary calculus.  Given dates $t<u$, the derivative defines a linear approximation of the change in $y$ over this time period; i.e., setting $\\Delta x = x(u)-x_t$ and $\\Delta y = y(u) - y_t$, we have the approximation\n$$\\Delta y \\approx g'(x_t) \\,\\Delta x\\; .$$\nA better approximation is given by the second-order Taylor series expansion\n$$\\Delta y \\approx g'(x_t)\\,\\Delta x + \\frac{1}{2} g''(x_t)\\,[\\Delta x]^2\\; .$$\nAn interpretation of  @eq-ordinarycalculus is that the linear approximation works perfectly for infinitesimal time periods $\\mathrm{d} t$, because we can compute the change in $y$ over the time period $[0,T]$ by summing up the infinitesimal changes $g'(x_t)\\,\\mathrm{d} x_t$.  In other words, the second-order term $\\frac{1}{2} g''(x_t)\\,[\\Delta x]^2$ vanishes when we consider very small time periods.\n\nThe second-order Taylor series expansion in the case of $Y=g(B)$ is \n$$\\Delta Y \\approx g'(B_t)\\,\\Delta B + \\frac{1}{2} g''(B_t)\\,[\\Delta B]^2\\; .$$\nFor example, given a partition $0=t_0 < t_1 < \\cdots < t_N=T$ of the time interval $[0,T]$, we have, with the same notation we have used earlier,\n\n$$\nY_t = Y_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Delta Y_{t_i}  \n$$\n$$\n\\approx Y_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^N g'(B_{t_{i-1}})\\,\\Delta B_{t_i} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N g''(B_{t_{i-1}})\\,[\\Delta B_{t_i}]^2\\;.\n$$ {#eq-itonew2}\n\n\nIf we make the time intervals $t_i-t_{i-1}$ shorter, letting $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, we cannot expect that the extra term here will disappear, leading to the result @eq-ordinarycalculus of the ordinary calculus, because we know that\n$$\\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^N [\\Delta B_{t_i}]^2 = T\\; ,$$\nwhereas for the continuously differentiable function $x_t = f_t$, the same limit is zero.  In fact it seems sensible to interpret the limit of $[\\Delta B]^2$ as $(\\mathrm{d} B)^2 =\\mathrm{d} t$.\nThis is perfectly consistent with Ito's formula: if we take the limit in @eq-itonew2, replacing the limit of $[\\Delta B_{t_i}]^2$ with $(\\mathrm{d} B)^2 = \\mathrm{d} t$, we obtain @eq-itonew1.\n\nThe code below defines a function $g(x)=e^{x}$ ($g'(x)=e^x$ and $g''(x) = e^x$) and simulates the value $e^{B_t}$ in two ways.

This means, for an asset with price $S_t$, that the dividend in an instant $\\mathrm{d} t$ is $q S_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t$.  If the dividends are reinvested in new shares, the number of shares will grow exponentially at rate $q$.  To see this, consider the portfolio starting with a single share of the asset and reinvesting dividends until some date $T$.  Let $X_t$ denote the number of shares resulting from this strategy at any time $t\\leq T$.  Then the dividend received at date $t$ is $q S_tX_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t$, which can be used to purchase $q X_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t$ new shares.  This implies that $\\mathrm{d} X_t=q X_t\\,\\mathrm{d} t$, or $\\mathrm{d} X_t/\\mathrm{d} t = q X_t$, and it is easy to check (and very well known) that this equation is solved by $X_t=\\mathrm{e}^{q t}X_0$.  In our case, with $X_0=1$, we have $X_t=\\mathrm{e}^{q t}$.\n\nThe dollar value of the trading strategy just described will be $X_tS_t = \\mathrm{e}^{q t}S_t$.  Denote this by $V_t$.  This is the value of a non-dividend-paying portfolio, because all dividends are reinvested.  From the Compounding/Discounting example in @sec-s_examples, we know that\n$$ \n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} V}{V} = q\\,\\mathrm{d} t + \\frac{\\mathrm{d} S}{S}\\;.\n$$ {#eq-reinvestingdividends}\n\nThis means that the rate of return on the portfolio is the dividend yield $q\\,\\mathrm{d} t$ plus the return $\\mathrm{d} S/S$ due to capital gains.\n\n\n## Geometric Brownian Motion {#sec-s_geometricbrownianmotion}\nA random variable is lognormally distributed if it can be written as $\\tilde{y}=  e^{\\tilde{x}}$ where $\\tilde{x}$ is distributed according to a normal distribution with mean $m$ and standard deviation $s$.

Note that for each time $t$, geometric Brownian motion is a lognormal random variable.\nUsing the product rule and the rule for exponentials, we obtain\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} S}{S} = \\mu\\,\\mathrm{d} t+\\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B\\;.\n$$ {#eq-Y}\n\nWhen we see an equation of the form @eq-Y, we should recognize @eq-exponential1 as the solution. \n\nThe process $S$ is called a geometric Brownian motion.  \\index{geometric Brownian motion} In keeping with the discussion of @sec-s_itoprocesses, we interpret @eq-Y as stating that $\\mu\\,\\mathrm{d} t$ is the expected rate of change of $S$ and $\\sigma^2\\,\\mathrm{d} t$ is the variance of the rate of change in an instant $\\mathrm{d} t$.  We call $\\mu$ the drift and $\\sigma$ the volatility.  \\index{volatility} The geometric Brownian motion will grow at the average rate of $\\mu$, in the sense that $\\\\E[S_t] = \\mathrm{e}^{\\mu t}S_0$;  one way to verify this uses the formula for the mean of a lognormal random variable.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of @eq-exponential1 gives an equivalent form of the solution:\n$$\n\\log S_t= \\log S_0+\\left(\\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\sigma B_t\\;.\n$$ {#eq-exponential2}\n  This shows that $\\log S_t - \\log S_0$ is a $(\\mu-\\sigma^2/2,\\sigma)$--Brownian motion.  Given information at time $t$, the logarithm of $S(u)$ for $u>t$ is normally \\index{lognormal distribution}distributed with mean $(u-t)(\\mu-\\sigma^2/2)$ and variance $(u-t)\\sigma^2$.  Because $S$ is the exponential of its logarithm, $S$ can never be negative.  For this reason, a geometric Brownian motion is a better model for stock prices than is a Brownian motion.\n\nThe differential of @eq-exponential2 is\n$$\n\\mathrm{d} \\log S_t = \\left(\\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d} t+ \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B_t\\;.\n$$ {#eq-exponential3}\n\nWe conclude:\n\n::: calculator\n\nThe  equation \n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} S}{S} = \\mu\\,\\mathrm{d} t+\\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B$$\nis equivalent to the equation\n$$\\mathrm{d} \\log S_t = \\left(\\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d} t+ \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d} B_t\\; .$$\nThe solution of both equations is @eq-exponential1 or the equivalent @eq-exponential2.\n\n:::\n\n\n\nOver a discrete time interval $\\Delta t$, @eq-exponential3 implies that the change in the logarithm of $S$ is \n$$\n\\Delta \\log S = \\left(\\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\Delta t+ \\sigma\\,\\Delta B\\;.\n$$ {#eq-exponential11}\n\nIf $S$ is the price of a non-dividend-paying asset, then over the time period $t_{i-1}$ to $t_i$, with $t_i-t_{i-1}=\\Delta t$, we have\n$$\n\\Delta \\log S = r_i\\,\\Delta t\\;,\n$$ {#eq-exponential10}\n\nwhere $r_i$ is the  continuously compounded annualized rate of return \\index{continuously compounded return} during the period $\\Delta t$.  This follows from the definition of the continuously compounded rate of return as the constant rate over the time period $\\Delta t$ that would cause $S$ to grow (or fall) from $S_{t_{i-1}}$ to $S_{t_i}$.  To be precise, $r_i$ is defined by\n$$\\frac{S_{t_i}}{S_{t_{i-1}}} = \\mathrm{e}^{r_i\\Delta t}\\; ,$$\nwhich is equivalent to @eq-exponential10.\nThus, the geometric Brownian motion model @eq-Y implies that the continuously compounded annualized rate of return over a period of length $\\Delta t$ is given by\n$$r_i = \\mu -\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2+ \\frac{\\sigma\\Delta B}{\\Delta t}\\; .$$\nThis means that $r_i$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu-\\sigma^2/2$ and variance $\\sigma^2/\\Delta t$.  Given historical data on the rates of return, the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ can be estimated by standard methods (see @sec-c_stochasticvolatility).\n\nWe can simulate a path of $S$ by simulating the changes $\\Delta \\log S$.  The random variable $\\sigma \\Delta B$  in  @eq-exponential11 has a normal distribution with zero mean and variance equal to $\\sigma^2\\Delta t$.  We simulate it as $\\sigma\\sqrt{\\Delta t}$ multiplied by a standard normal.  The code below simulates $n=10000$ paths with $m=1000$ time steps. There are some features of the simulation which will prove useful later.  The drift $\\mu$ is labelled the interest rate $r=0.1$.  Other parameters are $\\sigma = 0.2$, and $T=0.5$.  The drift of the log stock price is labelled $drift=r-\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}$.  The plot output is one of the simulated sample paths.  In practice, if we are only interested in the terminal value of the stock price we would use many fewer subdivisions, $n=1$.  Given a simulated mean zero normal random variable, $z$, changing the sign to $-z$ is also a simulated normal random variable with zero mean and the same standard deviation.  As a result, we have two simulations for the stock price labelled $St$ and $St1$, but we only plot one sample path for $St$. \n\n::: {#e9918933 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n\"\"\"\n# Simulate Geometric Brownian Motion\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# number of paths\nn = 10000\n#number of divisions\nm = 1000\n# Interest rate (We set the drift equal to the interest rate)\nr = 0.1\n# Volatility\nsig = 0.2\n# Initial Stock Price\nS0 = 42\n# Maturity\nT = 0.5\n# Delta t\ndt = T/m\n# Drift\ndrift = (r-0.5*sig**2)\n# Volatility\nvol = sig * np.sqrt(dt)\n\nt = np.array(range(0,m + 1,1)) * dt\n\n# seed for random generator\nseed= 2020\n# define a random generator\nnp.random.seed(seed)\ninc = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\ninc[1:] = np.transpose(np.random.normal(loc = 0, scale = vol,size = (n,m)))\nSt = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\nSt = S0 * np.exp(np.cumsum(inc,axis=0) + (drift * t[0:m + 1])[:,None])\nSt1 = S0 * np.exp(-np.cumsum(inc,axis=0) + (drift * t[0:m + 1])[:,None])\nplt.figure(figsize=(9,6))\nplt.plot(t,St[:,1])\n\"\"\"\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```\n'\\n# Simulate Geometric Brownian Motion\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n# number of paths\\nn = 10000\\n#number of divisions\\nm = 1000\\n# Interest rate (We set the drift equal to the interest rate)\\nr = 0.1\\n# Volatility\\nsig = 0.2\\n# Initial Stock Price\\nS0 = 42\\n# Maturity\\nT = 0.5\\n# Delta t\\ndt = T/m\\n# Drift\\ndrift = (r-0.5*sig**2)\\n# Volatility\\nvol = sig * np.sqrt(dt)\\n\\nt = np.array(range(0,m + 1,1)) * dt\\n\\n# seed for random generator\\nseed= 2020\\n# define a random generator\\nnp.random.seed(seed)\\ninc = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\\ninc[1:] = np.transpose(np.random.normal(loc = 0, scale = vol,size = (n,m)))\\nSt = np.zeros(shape = (m + 1, n))\\nSt = S0 * np.exp(np.cumsum(inc,axis=0) + (drift * t[0:m + 1])[:,None])\\nSt1 = S0 * np.exp(-np.cumsum(inc,axis=0) + (drift * t[0:m + 1])[:,None])\\nplt.figure(figsize=(9,6))\\nplt.plot(t,St[:,1])\\n'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plot below is the distribution of the simulated stock price at $T$.\n\n::: {#6b96e75e .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n\"\"\"\nplt.figure(figsize=(9,6))\na=plt.hist(St[m,:], bins=100)\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```\n'\\nplt.figure(figsize=(9,6))\\na=plt.hist(St[m,:], bins=100)\\n'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhile Geometric Brownian Motion is an important stochastic process to model stock prices, the process with drift equal to zero given by\n$$X_t = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\kappa^2}{2} + \\kappa B_t\\right)$$\n\nsatisfies $\\\\E[X_t]=1$ and $\\\\E[X_t|X(s)]=X(s)$ and is an important example of a strictly positive martingale.
