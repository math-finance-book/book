The rights are traded on exchanges and also as private contracts (called over-the-counter or OTC).  A call option is a right to buy an asset.  A put option is a right to sell an asset.  The pre-specified price is called the exercise price, the strike price, or simply the strike.   The asset to which an option pertains is called the underlying asset, or, more briefly, the underlying.  \n\nHere is a snapshot of market statistics regarding call options on Apple stock (AAPL) traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).

that are displayed is shown in the text above the table.  Many different maturities are traded each day.  The data shown is 15 minutes delayed (and obviously more than 15 minutes if the code is executed outside trading hours).\n\nThe first column shows the strike prices of the calls and puts that are available for trading. The exchange chooses which strikes people can trade and at which maturities.  As the price of AAPL stock moves, the exchange will introduce new strikes to maintain a bracket around the stock price.  Typically, interest in trading the strikes that become further away from the stock price will decline, except for people closing positions (discussed further below).\n\nWhen a strike is first introduced for trading, no one has a position in it.  Positions are created by trade.  We say that a buyer is long the option, and a seller is short.  These concepts are discussed further below.  The standard contract size is 100 shares, so a buyer of one contract is long options on 100 shares of the underlying asset (AAPL in this example), and a seller is short options on 100 shares.  The number of longs always equals the number of shorts.  If the first trade is for 1 contract, we say the open interest is 1 contract, meaning that there is 1 long and 1 short.  Subsequent trades increase the open interest if new positions are created or reduce the open interesting if existing positions are closed.  Open interest is shown in the penultimate column of the table.\n\nThe second column of the table shows the bid prices. The bid price is the highest price at which other traders are willing to buy (it is what traders are bidding for the option, as in bidding to buy a house).  So, if you submitted a market order to sell, you would trade at the bid, assuming the bid did not change before your order reached the exchange's computers.  Thus, the bid price is what you would pay for the right to buy AAPL at the strike price at any time up to and including the maturity date.\n\nThe ask price is the lowest price at which others are willing to sell (similar to the asking price for a house).  The difference between the ask price and the bid price is called the bid-ask spread.  You should think of half the spread as being the cost an investor pays in order to be able to trade immediately, and it is a return for supplying immediacy to those investors or market makers on the other side of the trade.  This is discussed further below.\n\nFor call options, bid and ask prices are lower for higher strikes.  It is better to have the right to buy AAPL at $100 a share than to have the right to buy it at $200 per share, so the market price of the former is higher than the price of the latter.\n\nThe fourth column of the table shows the most recent transaction price.  For strikes away from the current AAPL price, the most recent transaction may have been several days ago.  The change and %change are the changes during the current trading day relative to the last price of the prior day (more precisely, it is relative to the settlement price, which is discussed below).  The volume is the number of contracts traded on the most recent day on which the strike traded.  Implied volatility, shown in the last column, is discussed in Chapter ???.\n\n::: {#82fab28c .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Pull options data\nkind = \"put\"\ndf = (\n
