The rights are traded on exchanges and also as private contracts (called over-the-counter or OTC).  A call option is a right to buy an asset.  A put option is a right to sell an asset.  The pre-specified price is called the exercise price, the strike price, or simply the strike.   The asset to which an option pertains is called the underlying asset, or, more briefly, the underlying.  \n\nHere is a snapshot of market statistics regarding call options on Apple stock (AAPL) traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBO\\\\E).

table.  Many different maturities are traded throughout each day.  The data shown is 15 minutes delayed (and obviously more than 15 minutes if the code is executed outside trading hours).\n\nThe first column shows the strike prices of the calls and puts that are available for trading. The exchange chooses which strikes people can trade and at which maturities.  As the price of AAPL stock moves, the exchange will introduce new strikes to maintain a bracket around the stock price.  Typically, interest in trading the strikes that become further away from the stock price will decline, except for people closing positions.  Positions are closed when a trader makes an offsetting trade: buying the same maturity and strike if they sold before or selling if they bought before.  The offsetting trade cancels the option or obligation created by the initial trade, and the trader gains or loses the difference between the selling and buying prices.\n\nWhen a strike is first introduced for trading, no one has a position in it.  Positions are created by trade.  We say that a buyer is long the option, and a seller is short.  These concepts are discussed further below.  The standard contract size is 100 shares, so a buyer of one contract is long options on 100 shares of the underlying asset (AAPL in this example), and a seller is short options on 100 shares.  The number of longs always equals the number of shorts.  If the first trade is for 1 contract, we say the open interest is 1 contract, meaning that there is 1 long and 1 short.  Subsequent trades increase the open interest if new positions are created or reduce the open interest if existing positions are closed.  Open interest is shown in the penultimate column of the table.\n\nThe second column of the table shows the bid prices. The bid price is the highest price at which other traders are willing to buy (it is what traders are bidding for the option, as in bidding to buy a house).  So, if you submitted an order to sell at the market price (called a market order), you would trade at the bid, assuming the bid did not change before your order reached the exchange's computers.  Thus, the bid price is what you would pay for the right to buy AAPL at the strike price at any time up to and including the maturity date.\n\nThe ask price is the lowest price at which others are willing to sell (similar to the asking price for a house).  The difference between the ask price and the bid price is called the bid-ask spread.  An alternative to submitting a market order and trading at the bid or ask is to submit a limit order.  A limit order specifies a limit price: a buyer will not pay more than her specified limit price, and a seller will not receive less than his specified limit price.  For example, suppose you want to buy an option, and you submit a limit order with a price of $5.00. Of course, you will be happy to buy at a lower price also.  If the current market ask price is $4.90, then your order will execute immediately at $4.90.  On the other hand, if the market is trading at a bid of $5.10 and an ask of $5.25, then you cannot immediately buy at $5.00 or less, so your limit order will join the queue of limit orders, called the limit order book.  If the market for the option rises, then you will never be able to buy at $5.00, and your order will never execute.  However, if the market falls, then your $5.00 order will eventually become the best bid and execute against an incoming market sell order.\n\nFor call options, bid and ask prices are lower for higher strikes.  It is better to have the right to buy AAPL at $100 a share than to have the right to buy it at $200 per share, so the market price of the former is higher than the price of the latter.\n\nThe fourth column of the table shows the most recent transaction price.  For strikes away from the current AAPL price, the most recent transaction may have been several days ago.  The change and %change are the changes during the current trading day relative to the last price of the prior day (more precisely, it is relative to the settlement price, which is discussed below).  The volume is the number of contracts traded on the most recent day on which the strike traded.  Implied volatility, shown in the last column, is discussed in Chapter @sec-c_black_scholes.\n\n::: {#ba9a44d6 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Pull options data\nkind = \"put\"\ndf = (\n    tick.option_chain(date).calls\n    if kind == \"call\"\n    else tick.option_chain(date).puts\n)\n\ndf.lastTradeDate = df.lastTradeDate.map(\n    lambda x: x.astimezone(est).strftime(fmt)\n)\n\n# Formatting\ncols = [\n    \"strike\",\n    \"bid\",\n    \"ask\",\n    \"lastPrice\",\n    \"change\",\n    \"percentChange\",\n    \"lastTradeDate\",\n    \"volume\",\n    \"openInterest\",\n    \"impliedVolatility\",\n]\ndf = df[cols]\ndf[\"impliedVolatility\"] = df[\"impliedVolatility\"].map(\"{:.1%}\".format)\ndf[\"change\"] = df[\"change\"].round(2)\ndf[\"percentChange\"] = (df[\"percentChange\"]/100).map(\"{:.1%}\".format)\ndf.columns = [\n    \"Strike\",\n    \"Bid\",\n    \"Ask\",\n    \"Last Price\",\n    \"Change\",\n    \"% Change\",\n    \"Time of Last Trade\",\n    \"Volume\",\n    \"Open Interest\",\n    \"Implied Volatility\",\n] \ndf = df.set_index(\"Strike\")\nprint(f'Maturity date of options:\\t{date}')\nprint(f\"Code executed at \\t{now}\")\nprint(f\"Last {ticker.upper()} price was \\t${close:.2f}.\")\n\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\npd.set_option('display.width', 1000)\nprint(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nMaturity date of options:\t2025-02-07\nCode executed at \t2025-01-06 10:21:15\nLast AAPL price was \t$245.38.\n          Bid    Ask  Last Price  Change % Change   Time of Last Trade  Volume  Open Interest Implied Volatility\nStrike                                                                                                          \n180.0    0.19   0.26        0.27    0.00     0.0%  2025-01-03 14:45:19     6.0            342              51.1%\n185.0    0.22   0.29        0.28    0.00     0.0%  2025-01-03 15:12:49     5.0              5              47.9%\n190.0    0.26   0.33        0.41    0.00     0.0%  2025-01-02 15:59:24    25.0             45              45.0%\n195.0    0.31   0.35        0.39    0.00     0.0%  2025-01-03 15:55:12    11.0             22              41.5%\n200.0    0.38   0.43        0.39   -0.07   -15.2%  2025-01-06 09:46:35     6.0            495              39.1%\n205.0    0.45   0.52        0.58    0.00     0.0%  2025-01-03 15:55:12    36.0             55              36.5%\n210.0    0.59   0.64        0.61   -0.11   -15.3%  2025-01-06 09:42:40    29.0            148              33.9%\n215.0    0.77   0.83        0.80   -0.16   -16.7%  2025-01-03 15:55:09     2.0            227              31.7%\n220.0    1.04   1.10        1.01   -0.31   -23.5%  2025-01-06 09:37:48     9.0            374              29.6%\n225.0    1.51   1.56        1.54   -0.32   -17.4%  2025-01-06 09:50:44   174.0            836              28.0%\n230.0    2.12   2.24        2.14   -0.61   -22.2%  2025-01-06 09:49:15    67.0            795              26.6%\n235.0    3.10   3.25        3.20   -0.75   -19.0%  2025-01-06 09:43:59     2.0            857              25.3%\n240.0    4.60   4.70        4.67   -0.71   -13.2%  2025-01-06 09:43:16    45.0            445              24.3%\n245.0    6.55   6.70        6.60   -0.93   -12.4%  2025-01-06 09:43:42    25.0            593              23.4%\n250.0    9.10   9.25        9.71   -0.54    -5.3%  2025-01-03 15:58:14     1.0            288              22.5%\n255.0   12.30  12.50       11.80   -1.81   -13.3%  2025-01-06 09:32:17     7.0            233              22.0%\n260.0   16.20  17.20       16.10   -1.90   -10.6%  2025-01-06 09:48:37    11.0            100              25.7%\n265.0   20.40  20.80       22.30    0.00     0.0%  2025-01-03 12:11:18     7.0           7515              23.0%\n270.0   24.40  26.60       27.35    0.00     0.0%  2025-01-03 15:34:18     8.0              8              31.4%\n275.0   28.60  31.90       29.83    0.00     0.0%  2025-01-02 09:42:04     NaN              0              36.9%\n280.0   33.30  36.90       29.29    0.00     0.0%  2024-12-31 12:29:47     1.0              0              40.6%\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Intrinsic Value and Time Value\n\n\n\n\n\n## Investing in Options\n\n\n## Hedging with Options\n\n\n## Selling Options for Income\n\n\n## Option Spreads\n\n\n::: {#fig-option_portfolios fig-cap=\"The value at maturity of a portfolio of options is plotted, assuming all of the options have the same maturity.
