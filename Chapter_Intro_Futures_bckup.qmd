# Futures  {#sec-c:futures}

Futures contracts are among the oldest and most important derivative securities, with organized futures trading dating back centuries. These standardized agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date serve critical functions in modern financial markets, from price discovery and risk management to speculation and arbitrage.

A **futures contract** is a standardized agreement between two parties to trade a specific asset at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Unlike forward contracts, which are customized over-the-counter agreements, futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges with standardized terms, daily settlement, and clearinghouse guarantees.

## Key Features of Futures Contracts

#### Standardization and Exchange Trading

**Contract Specifications**: Exchanges standardize every aspect of futures contracts:
- **Underlying asset**: Specific grade, quality, and delivery location
- **Contract size**: Standard quantity (e.g., 5,000 bushels of corn, 100 troy ounces of gold)
- **Delivery months**: Specific months when contracts expire
- **Tick size**: Minimum price movement (e.g., $0.25 per bushel for corn)
- **Daily price limits**: Maximum allowed price changes in a single session

**Example**: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) E-mini S&P 500 futures contract specifies:
- Underlying: S&P 500 Index
- Contract size: $50 × S&P 500 Index value
- Delivery months: March, June, September, December
- Tick size: 0.25 index points = $12.50 per contract

#### Long and Short Positions

**Long Position**: Agreement to buy the underlying asset
- Profits when futures price rises
- Obligated to accept delivery (unless closed before expiration)
- Initial margin required

**Short Position**: Agreement to sell the underlying asset  
- Profits when futures price falls
- Obligated to make delivery (unless closed before expiration)
- Initial margin required

Unlike options, both parties to a futures contract have obligations, not rights.

#### Physical vs. Cash Settlement

**Physical Settlement**: Actual delivery of the underlying asset
- Common for commodities (agricultural products, metals, energy)
- Delivery occurs at exchange-designated locations
- Most contracts are closed before delivery

**Cash Settlement**: Payment of cash difference between futures and spot prices
- Used for financial futures (stock indices, interest rates)
- No physical asset changes hands
- Settlement price typically based on underlying index value

## Marking to Market

One of the most distinctive features of futures trading is the **daily settlement** or **marking to market** process. This mechanism virtually eliminates counterparty risk and enables leverage while maintaining market integrity.

#### The Daily Settlement Process

**End-of-Day Valuation**: Each trading day, the exchange establishes a **settlement price** (typically close to the closing price) for each futures contract. All open positions are marked to this price.

**Variation Margin**: The daily profit or loss on each position is calculated and immediately transferred between accounts:
- **Profit**: Credited to the trader's margin account
- **Loss**: Debited from the trader's margin account

**Example**: Suppose you buy one S&P 500 futures contract at 4,000:
- Day 1: Settlement price = 4,010 → Gain = (4,010 - 4,000) × $50 = $500 (credited to your account)
- Day 2: Settlement price = 3,990 → Loss = (3,990 - 4,010) × $50 = $1,000 (debited from your account)
- Day 3: Settlement price = 4,020 → Gain = (4,020 - 3,990) × $50 = $1,500 (credited to your account)

#### Margin Requirements

**Initial Margin**: Deposit required to open a futures position
- Typically 3-12% of contract value (much lower than stock margin)
- Provides leverage but amplifies risk
- Set by exchanges based on volatility and risk assessment

**Maintenance Margin**: Minimum account balance required to keep position open
- Usually 75-80% of initial margin
- If account falls below maintenance margin, a **margin call** occurs

**Margin Call Process**:
1. Account balance falls below maintenance margin
2. Trader must deposit additional funds (variation margin) to restore account to initial margin level
3. If trader fails to meet margin call, position is liquidated

#### Why Marking to Market Works

**Eliminates Credit Risk**: Daily settlement ensures that losers pay winners immediately, preventing the accumulation of large credit exposures.

**Enables Leverage**: Because credit risk is minimized, exchanges can offer high leverage ratios that would be impossible in other markets.

**Price Transparency**: Daily marking provides continuous price discovery and ensures that futures prices reflect current market conditions.

**Liquidity Enhancement**: Reduced counterparty risk attracts more participants, increasing market liquidity.

## The Expectations Hypothesis

The **expectations hypothesis** states that futures prices represent the market's unbiased expectation of future spot prices. Mathematically, this can be written as:
$$F = E[S_T]$$

Where $E[S_T]$ is the expected spot price at the futures expiration date $T$.  This is a convenient hypothesis, because, if true, then futures prices provide a readily observable measure of the market's expectations for future spot prices.

The motivation for the expectations hypothesis is the idea that, if the futures price were lower than the expected spot price, then traders "should" buy the futures contract and plan to sell the spot asset when delivered on the futures at maturity.  This strategy has a positive expected profit when the futures price is lower than the expected spot price.  This buying activity should drive up the price of the futures contract, until it converges to the expected spot price.  Symmetrically, investors "should" sell the futures if its price is above the expected spot price, planning to buy the spot asset at the futures maturity to cover the delivery obligation on the futures, and this selling activity should cause the futures price to fall, until it converges to the expected spot price.  Thus, in equilibrium, futures prices "should" equal the expected spot price. 

All of the quotation marks around "should" in the previous paragraph reflect the fact that the theory presumes risk neutrality on the part of a large enough group of investors to move the futures price to the expected spot price.  If investors are risk averse, then they may buy a limited quantity of the futures when its price is low relative to the expected spot price and sell a limited quantity of the futures when its price is high relative to the expected spot price, generating an expected profit as described in the previous paragraph.  However, risk averse investors will weigh the expected profit against the risk, considering their other investments as well, and only allocate a limited amount of capital to the bet.  This amount of capital may not be enough to move the futures price fully to the expected spot price.  Empirically, futures prices seem to frequently deviate from expected spot prices in significant ways, indicating that the risk-neutrality assumption underlying the expectations hypothesis is not a good one.

## Spot-Futures Parity

In contrast to the expectations hypothesis, which predicts a relationship between today's futures price and the expected future spot price, **spot-futures parity** is a relationship between today's futures price and today's spot price.  The foundation for spot-futures parity is arbitrage activity (making riskless profits) rather than making positive expected return but risky investments (as for the expectations hypothesis).

#### The Basic Parity Relationship

For a futures contract on a non-dividend-paying asset:

$$F = S e^{rT}$$

Where:

- $F$ = Futures price
- $S$ = Current spot price  
- $r$ = Risk-free interest rate
- $T$ = Time to expiration


#### Derivation Through Arbitrage

Consider two strategies with identical payoffs at time $T$:

**Strategy A**: Buy futures contract at price $F$

- Cost today: $0$ (ignoring margin)
- Payoff at $T$: $S_T - F$

**Strategy B**: Buy underlying asset, finance with borrowing

- Cost today: $S - S = 0$ (borrow $S$ to buy asset worth $S$)  
- Payoff at $T$: $S_T - Se^{rT}$ (asset value minus loan repayment)

Both strategies have zero cost at initiation and pay the underlying asset value at the futures maturity less *an amount known at strategy initiation*.  There is an arbitrage opportunity if these amounts differ, so it must be that they are the same; that is,  
$$F = Se^{rT}\,.$$


#### Incorporating Dividends and Storage Costs

For an asset that pays dividends, the futures price is lower than the previous formula predicts, because futures holders don't receive dividend payments.  The correct formula for a dividend-paying asset is:

$$F = (S - PV(\text{Dividends}))e^{rT}$$

The derivation of this formula is again by arbitrage with the same two strategies as above.  The only difference is that in Strategy B, the trader can use the future value of the dividends to repay part of the loan, so the payoff at $T$ is 
$$S_T - Se^{rT} + FV(\text{Dividends})\,.$$

Assume the future value of the dividends can be predicted at strategy initiation, the same arbitrage logic as before implies that 

$$F = S e^{rT}- FV(\text{Dividends}) = (S- \text{PV}(\text{Dividends}))e^{rT}\,.$$

**Commodities with Storage Costs**:
$$F = Se^{(r+c)T}$$

Where $c$ = storage cost rate. Storage costs increase the futures price because they represent an additional carrying cost.

**Convenience Yield**:
For commodities, there may be benefits to physical ownership (convenience yield $y$):
$$F = Se^{(r+c-y)T}$$

Convenience yield can make futures prices lower than the basic cost-of-carry model predicts.

#### Arbitrage When Parity Is Violated

**If $F > Se^{rT}$ (Futures overpriced)**:

1. Sell futures contract
2. Buy underlying asset  
3. Finance purchase by borrowing $S$
4. At expiration: Deliver asset against futures, collect $F$, repay loan $Se^{rT}$
5. Risk-free profit: $F - Se^{rT}$

**If $F < Se^{rT}$ (Futures underpriced)**:

1. Buy futures contract
2. Sell underlying asset short
3. Invest proceeds $S$ at risk-free rate
4. At expiration: Take delivery via futures, return borrowed asset, collect investment proceeds
5. Risk-free profit: $Se^{rT} - F$

#### Practical Considerations

**Transaction Costs**: Reduce arbitrage opportunities and create a **no-arbitrage band** around theoretical parity.

**Borrowing vs. Lending Rates**: Different rates for borrowing and lending create wider no-arbitrage bands.

**Delivery Options**: Many futures contracts give the short party choices about delivery timing, location, or grade, making exact parity calculations complex.



#### Backwardation vs. Contango

**Backwardation**: Futures prices below expected future spot prices
- $F < E[S_T]$
- Hedgers are net short, speculators are net long
- Speculators earn risk premium for bearing price risk

**Contango**: Futures prices above expected future spot prices  
- $F > E[S_T]$
- Hedgers are net long, speculators are net short
- Hedgers pay risk premium to transfer price risk

**Example**: Agricultural commodities often exhibit seasonal patterns:
- Post-harvest: Abundant supply, low spot prices, futures in contango
- Pre-harvest: Low inventory, high spot prices, futures in backwardation

#### The Theory of Storage

The **theory of storage** explains futures price patterns for storable commodities:

**High Inventory Periods**:
- Storage is costly, convenience yield is low
- Futures prices exceed spot prices (contango)
- Market expects lower future prices as new supply arrives

**Low Inventory Periods**:
- Storage provides high convenience yield
- Spot prices exceed futures prices (backwardation)  
- Market fears supply shortages

#### Modern Portfolio Theory Perspective

Modern finance theory suggests that futures prices should include risk premiums related to systematic risk:

$$F = E[S_T] - \text{Risk Premium}$$

**Risk Premium Determinants**:
- Correlation between commodity returns and market portfolio
- Systematic risk of the underlying asset
- Risk aversion of market participants

**Empirical Evidence**:
- Mixed support for pure expectations hypothesis
- Some commodities show persistent backwardation or contango
- Risk premiums appear to vary over time and across commodities

## Options on Futures

Many exchanges offer **options on futures contracts**, creating a derivative on a derivative. These instruments combine the features of options (limited downside risk) with the efficiency and liquidity of futures markets.

#### Contract Specifications

**Call Option on Futures**: Right to buy a futures contract at a specified strike price
- Exercise creates a long futures position at the strike price
- Immediate mark-to-market profit/loss upon exercise

**Put Option on Futures**: Right to sell a futures contract at a specified strike price
- Exercise creates a short futures position at the strike price
- Immediate mark-to-market profit/loss upon exercise

#### Exercise and Settlement

**American-Style**: Most options on futures can be exercised any time before expiration

**Exercise Process**:
1. Option holder notifies broker of exercise decision
2. Clearinghouse assigns exercise to a random short option holder
3. Assigned option writer receives a futures position
4. Both parties receive immediate mark-to-market settlement

**Example**: Crude oil futures trading at $80, holder exercises $75 call:
- Call holder receives long futures position at $75
- Immediate credit: $(80 - 75) × 1,000 = $5,000$ per contract
- Option writer receives short futures position at $75
- Immediate debit: $5,000 per contract


#### Strategic Applications

**Hedging Futures Positions**:
- Long futures + long put = Limited downside, unlimited upside
- Short futures + long call = Limited downside, unlimited upside

**Speculation with Limited Risk**:
- Buy calls/puts instead of futures to limit maximum loss to premium
- Leverage benefits of futures with risk management of options

**Spread Trading**:
- Calendar spreads using options on different expiration futures
- Volatility trading using straddles and strangles

#### Advantages Over Options on Spot Assets

**Leverage**: Futures provide inherent leverage, amplifying option sensitivity

**Liquidity**: Major futures markets often more liquid than spot markets

**No Storage Costs**: Options on financial futures avoid physical storage issues

**Extended Trading Hours**: Many futures markets trade nearly 24 hours

**Mark-to-Market**: Immediate settlement reduces counterparty risk

## Hedging with Options vs Futures

When facing price risk, market participants often choose between futures contracts and options on futures for hedging purposes. While both instruments can provide price protection, they offer fundamentally different risk-reward profiles. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective risk management.

#### The Oil Refiner's Dilemma

Consider an oil refiner who needs to purchase crude oil three months from now to produce gasoline. The refiner faces the risk that crude oil prices will rise, increasing production costs and potentially reducing profit margins. Two primary hedging strategies are available:

**Strategy 1: Buy Crude Oil Futures**
- Lock in today's futures price for delivery in three months
- Completely eliminate price risk
- No additional cost beyond margin requirements

**Strategy 2: Buy Call Options on Crude Oil Futures**  
- Establish a maximum purchase price (strike price)
- Retain the ability to benefit if prices fall
- Pay an upfront premium for this flexibility

#### The Problem of Ex-Post Regret

The fundamental trade-off between these strategies becomes apparent when we consider **ex-post regret** - the retrospective evaluation of hedging decisions after outcomes are known.

**Futures Hedging and Regret**:
When a refiner uses futures to lock in crude oil prices, perfect price certainty is achieved. However, this certainty comes with the cost of regret when market conditions move favorably:

- **If crude prices rise**: The refiner feels satisfied with the hedge, having avoided higher costs
- **If crude prices fall**: The refiner experiences regret, knowing they could have purchased oil at lower market prices without the hedge

This regret is not merely psychological - it represents real economic opportunity cost. The futures hedge prevented the refiner from capitalizing on favorable price movements.

**Options Hedging and Asymmetric Outcomes**:
Call options on futures provide a fundamentally different risk profile:

- **If crude prices rise above the strike**: Exercise the option and purchase at the predetermined strike price, similar to the futures outcome
- **If crude prices fall below the strike**: Let the option expire and purchase at the lower market prices

The option strategy eliminates regret from favorable price movements while maintaining protection against adverse moves. However, this flexibility requires paying the option premium upfront.

#### When to Choose Each Strategy

**Futures are Optimal When**:
- Budget certainty is paramount (e.g., fixed-price customer contracts)
- Risk tolerance is low and any price uncertainty is unacceptable
- Option premiums are expensive relative to expected volatility
- The hedger has strong directional views about future price movements

**Options are Optimal When**:
- The hedger wants to maintain upside potential
- Competitive dynamics reward flexibility in input costs
- Option premiums are reasonable relative to the protection provided
- The hedger cannot tolerate the regret associated with missed opportunities

#### Portfolio Considerations

In practice, sophisticated hedgers often combine both approaches:

**Partial Hedging**: Use futures to hedge a baseline amount and options for additional protection
**Time-Varying Strategies**: Adjust the futures-to-options ratio based on market conditions and premium levels
**Strike Selection**: Choose option strikes that balance premium costs with desired protection levels

#### Summary

The oil refinery example illustrates broader principles applicable across commodity and financial markets. Whether hedging currency exposure, interest rate risk, or agricultural price volatility, the fundamental choice between certainty (futures) and flexibility (options) is central to effective risk management strategy.
