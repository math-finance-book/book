        "\n",
        "We will only discuss a few exotic options.  The reason for studying the derivation of an option pricing formula is that it may better equip one to analyze new products.  Hopefully, this chapter will be of some assistance in that regard.  Of course, one cannot expect to derive a closed-form solution for the value of every product, and often numerical methods  will be necessary.  For a much more comprehensive presentation of exotic option pricing formulas, the book by Haug [@Haug] and the Excel software that accompanies it are highly recommended.  Zhang [@Zhang] is also a comprehensive reference for exotics. \n",
        "\n",
        "The valuation of an American call option on an asset paying a discrete cash dividend (rather than a continuous dividend) is considered in @sec-s_discrete.  Under a particular assumption on the volatility, valuing this option is very similar to valuing a compound option.  Except for the assumption of a discrete dividend in @sec-s_discrete, we will make the Black-Scholes assumptions throughout this chapter: there is a constant risk-free rate $r$ and the underlying asset has a  constant volatility $\\sigma$ and a constant dividend yield $q$. \n",
        "\n",
        "The order in which exotics are presented in this chapter is based on the simplicity of the analysis---the chapter begins with the easiest to analyze and works towards the more difficult.  This order is roughly the inverse of importance, the most important exotics in practice being barriers, baskets, spreads and Asians.  In the cases of Asian and basket options, we will explain why there are no simple closed-form formulas (sums of lognormally distributed random variables are not lognormal).  We will use these cases and discretely-sampled barriers and lookbacks as examples in the next chapter.  \n",

Thus, we need the price of a numeraire asset at date $T'$.  We would like this price to be a constant times $S(T)$, which is what we will obtain.  An equivalent numeraire is to make a smaller investment in the same portfolio: start with $\\mathrm{e}^{-r(T'-T)-qT}$ shares.  This results in a final value of $S(T)$ at date $T'$.  As will be seen, this is useful for deriving the put-call parity relation for forward-start options.]purchase $\\mathrm{e}^{-qT}$ shares of the stock at date 0 and reinvest dividends until date $T$.

For simplicity, we assume that the date of the dividend payment is also the date that the asset goes ex-dividend; i.e., ownership of the asset at any date $t<T$ entitles the owner to receive the dividend at date $T$.

        "\\index{barrier option} \\index{down-and-out option} \\index{down-and-in option} \\index{knock-out option} \\index{knock-in option} A down-and-out call pays the usual call value at maturity if and only if the stock price does not hit a specified lower bound during the lifetime of the option.  If it does breach the lower barrier, then it is out.  Conversely, a down-and-in call pays off only if the stock price does hit the lower bound.  Up-and-out and up-and-in calls are defined similarly, and there are also put options of this sort.  The out versions are called knock-outs and the in versions are called knock-ins.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Knock-ins can be priced from knock-outs and vice-versa.  For example, the combination of a down-and-out call and a down-and-in call creates a standard European call, so the value of a down-and-in can be obtained by subtracting the value of a down-and-out from the value of a standard European call.  Likewise, up-and-in calls can be valued by subtracting the value of an up-and-out from the value of a standard European call.  Both knock-outs and knock-ins are of course less expensive than comparable standard options.\n",

        "\n",
        "We will describe the pricing of a down-and-out call.  The pricing of up-and-out calls and knock-out puts is similar.  Often there are rebates associated with the knocking-out of a barrier option, but we will not include that feature here (see @sec-s_finitedifferencebarriers however).  \n",
        "\n",
        "A down-and-out call provides a hedge against an increase in an asset price, just as does a standard call, for someone who is short the asset.  The difference is that the down-and-out is knocked out when the asset price falls sufficiently.  Presumably this is acceptable to the buyer because the need to hedge against high prices diminishes when the price falls.  In fact, in this circumstance the buyer may want  to establish a new hedge at a lower strike.  However, absent re-hedging at a lower strike, the buyer of a knock-out call obviously faces the risk that the price may reverse course after falling to the knock-out boundary, leading to regret that the option was knocked out.  The rationale for accepting this risk is  that the knock-out is cheaper than a standard call.  Thus, compared to a standard call, a down-and-out call provides cheaper but incomplete insurance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of a knock-out call and a knock-in call (or knock-out puts) with the same barrier and different strikes creates an option with a strike that is reset when the barrier is hit.  This is a hedge that adjusts automatically to the market.  An example is given in Probs.~\\ref{e_standardknockout3} and~\\ref{e_standardknockout4}.\n",

        "A spread option \\index{spread option} \\index{basket option} is a call or a put written on the difference of two asset prices.  For example, a spread call will pay at maturity $T$ the larger of zero and $S_1(T)-S_2(T)-K$, where the $S_i$ are the asset prices and $K$ is the strike price of the call.  Spread options can be used by producers to hedge the difference between an input price and an output price.  They are also useful for hedging basis risk.  For example, someone may want to hedge an asset by selling a futures contract on a closely related but not identical asset.  This exposes the hedger to basis risk: the difference in value between the asset and the underlying asset on the futures contract.  A spread call can hedge the basis risk: take $S_1$ to be the value of the asset underlying the futures contract and $S_2$ the value of the asset being hedged.\n",

        "However, we cannot apply Margrabe's formula to price spread options, because the second portfolio described above will have a stochastic volatility.  To see this, note that if the price $S_2(t)$ falls to a low level, then the portfolio will consist primarily of the risk-free asset, so the portfolio volatility will be near the volatility of the risk-free asset, which is zero.  On the other hand, if $S_2(t)$ becomes very high, then the portfolio will be weighted very heavily on the stock investment, and its volatility will approach the volatility of $S_2$.\n",

        "\n",
        "\\index{basket option} \\index{spread option} \\index{Monte Carlo} In this section, we will consider the valuation of European spread and basket options by the Monte Carlo method.  As noted in @sec-s_baskets, there are no simple formulas for these options. In each simulation, we will generate a terminal price for each of the underlying assets and compute the value of the option at its maturity. \n",
        "Discounting the average terminal value gives the estimate of the option value as usual.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between binomial and Monte Carlo methods for options written on multiple assets can be understood as follows.  Both methods attempt to estimate the discounted expected value of the option (under the risk-neutral measure).  In an $N$--period model, the binomial model produces $N+1$ values for the terminal price of each underlying asset.  Letting $k$ denote the number of underlying assets, this produces $(N+1)^k$ combinations of asset prices.  Of course, each combination has an associated probability.  In contrast, the Monte Carlo method produces $M$ combinations of terminal prices, where $M$ is the number of simulations.  Each combination is given the same weight ($1/M$) when estimating the expected value.  \n",
        "\n",
        "With a single underlying asset, the binomial model is more efficient, as discussed in @sec-s_introbinomial, because the specifically chosen terminal prices in the binomial model sample the set of possible terminal prices more efficiently than randomly generated terminal prices.  However, this advantage disappears, and the ranking of the methods can be reversed, when there are several underlying assets.  The reason is that many of the $(N+1)^k$ combinations of prices in the binomial model will have very low probabilities.  For example, with two assets that are positively correlated, it is very unlikely that one asset will be at its highest value in the binomial model and the other asset simultaneously at its lowest.  It is computationally wasteful to evaluate the option for such a combination, because the probability-weighted value will be very small and hence contribute little to the estimate of the expected value.  On the other hand, each set of terminal prices generated by the Monte Carlo method will be generated from a distribution having the assumed correlation.  Thus, only relatively likely combinations will typically be generated, and time is not wasted on evaluating unlikely combinations.  However, it should not be concluded that Monte Carlo valuation of a derivative on multiple assets will be quick and easy---even though the computation time required for more underlying assets does not increase as much with Monte Carlo as for binomial models, it can nevertheless be substantial.\n",

        "\\index{basket option} \\index{spread option} \\index{binomial model} By combining binomial models, we can  value options or other derivatives on multiple assets.  We will illustrate for an option on two assets.  This is the most important case, and the extension to more than two assets is straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider two stocks with constant dividend yields $q_i$ and constant volatilities $\\sigma_i$.  Suppose the two Brownian motions driving the two stocks have a constant correlation coefficient $\\rho$.  We will denote the price of stock $i$ ($i=1,2$) in the up state in each period by $u_iS_i$ and the price in the down state by $d_iS_i$, where $S_i$ is the price at the beginning of the period, and $u_i$ and $d_i$ are parameters to be specified.  In each period, there are four possible combinations of returns on the two stocks:  up for both stocks, up for stock 1 and down for stock~2, down for stock 1 and up for stock 2, and down for both stocks.  Denote the probabilities of these four combinations by $p_{uu}$, $p_{ud}$, $p_{du}$, and $p_{dd}$ respectively.  Thus, there are eight parameters in the binomial model: the number $N$ of periods (which defines the length of each period as $\\Delta t=T/N$ where $T$ is the option maturity), the up and down parameters $u_i$ and $d_i$ for each stock, and three probabilities (the fourth probability being determined by the condition that the probabilities sum to one).\n",

        "Given the period length $\\Delta t$, we want to choose the up and down parameters and the probabilities to match (or approximately match in an appropriate sense) the means, variances and covariances of the returns $\\Delta S_i/S_i$ or the continuously-compounded returns $\\Delta \\log S_i$.  There are two means, two variances and one covariance, so there are five restrictions to be satisfied and seven parameters.

This solution and a  Python function for valuing an American spread call option are given later.  This function operates much like the binomial valuation of American options described in @sec-c_introcomputation.  The primary difference is that the value of the option at maturity depends on both stock prices, so we have to consider each possible combination of stock prices.  In an $N$--period model, there are $N+1$ nodes at the final date for each of the two stocks, and hence $(N+1)^2$ possible combinations of nodes.  In fact, at each date $n$ ($n=0,\\ldots,N$) there are $(n+1)^2$ combinations of nodes to be considered.  \n",

This can be a serious problem.  For example, with five assets and $N=99$, we would have $100^5$ (10 billion) combinations.  As this suggests, problems with multiple assets quickly become intractable in a binomial framework.  This is called the curse of dimensionality. \\index{curse of dimensionality}\n",

Unlike traditional futures, which provide a payoff based on the difference between the underlying asset's price and the futures price, variance swaps provide a payoff based on the difference between the realized variance of the underlying asset and the predetermined variance level (termed ``Strike'' in practice), which is the futures price in variance unit. \n",

Unlike traditional options, variance swaps allow investors to speculate on or hedge against changes in volatility without the need for constant delta hedging. This makes them an effective tool for managing volatility risk and for executing volatility arbitrage strategies, as they simplify the trading of variance and offer a more straightforward payoff structure based on realized versus implied volatility.\n",
